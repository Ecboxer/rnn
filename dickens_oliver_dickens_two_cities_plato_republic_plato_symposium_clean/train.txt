EOS Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. EOS The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. EOS Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. EOS There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. EOS The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter. EOS As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, 'Let me see the child, and die.' EOS The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. EOS As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:  'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.' EOS 'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' EOS Think what it is to be a mother, there's a dear young lamb do.' EOS Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect. EOS The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child. EOS The surgeon deposited it in her arms. EOS They talked of hope and comfort. EOS They had been strangers too long. EOS 'It's all over, Mrs. EOS Thingummy!' EOS said the surgeon at last. EOS 'You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,' said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. EOS 'It's very likely it _will_ be troublesome. EOS He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, 'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?' EOS 'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the overseer's order. EOS She was found lying in the street. EOS The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. EOS 'The old story,' he said, shaking his head: 'no wedding-ring, I see. EOS Ah! EOS Good-night!' EOS The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant. EOS What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! EOS Oliver cried lustily. EOS If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder. EOS The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. EOS The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. EOS The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. EOS The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. EOS So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. EOS Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher. EOS Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. EOS Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this. EOS Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. EOS But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. EOS Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. EOS It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. EOS But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast. EOS It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. EOS Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate. EOS 'Goodness gracious! EOS Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?' EOS said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy. EOS '(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash 'em directly.) EOS Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!' EOS Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's. EOS 'Lor, only think,' said Mrs. Mann, running out,--for the three boys had been removed by this time,--'only think of that! EOS That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! EOS Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.' EOS Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle. EOS 'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,' inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, 'to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans? EOS Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?' EOS 'I'm sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,' replied Mrs. Mann with great humility. EOS Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance. EOS He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. EOS He relaxed. EOS 'Well, well, Mrs. Mann,' he replied in a calmer tone; 'it may be as you say; it may be. EOS Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.' EOS Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him. EOS Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled. EOS Yes, he smiled. EOS 'You've had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn't mention it. EOS Bumble?' EOS 'Not a drop. EOS Nor a drop,' said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner. EOS 'I think you will,' said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. EOS Mr. Bumble coughed. EOS 'Now, just a leetle drop,' said Mrs. Mann persuasively. EOS 'What is it?' EOS 'It's gin. EOS I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. EOS inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing. EOS 'Ah, bless 'em, that I do, dear as it is,' replied the nurse. EOS 'No'; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; 'no, you could not. EOS You are a humane woman, Mrs. EOS Mann.' EOS Mann.' EOS Mann.' EOS (He stirred the gin-and-water.) EOS 'I--I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann'; and he swallowed half of it. EOS 'And now about business,' said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket-book. EOS 'The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old to-day.' EOS 'Bless him!' EOS 'And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound. EOS Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat'ral exertions on the part of this parish,' said Bumble, 'we have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother's settlement, name, or condition.' EOS Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment's reflection, 'How comes he to have any name at all, then?' EOS The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, 'I inwented it.' EOS 'You, Mr. EOS Bumble!' EOS We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. EOS The last was a S,--Swubble, I named him. EOS The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. EOS 'Why, you're quite a literary character, sir!' EOS said Mrs. Mann. EOS 'Well, well,' said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; 'perhaps I may be. EOS Perhaps I may be, Mrs. EOS Mann.' EOS He finished the gin-and-water, and added, 'Oliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house. EOS So let me see him at once.' EOS 'I'll fetch him directly,' said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose. EOS Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress. EOS Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle's chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance. EOS He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection. EOS 'No, she can't,' replied Mr. Bumble. EOS 'But she'll come and see you sometimes.' EOS This was no very great consolation to the child. EOS Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away. EOS Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. EOS Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse. EOS And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him. EOS Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child's heart for the first time. EOS Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were 'nearly there.' EOS To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle. EOS Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith. EOS Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. EOS He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. EOS 'Bow to the board,' said Bumble. EOS Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that. EOS 'What's your name, boy?' EOS said the gentleman in the high chair. EOS These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool. EOS Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease. EOS 'What's that, sir?' EOS 'You know you've got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don't you?' EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, weeping bitterly. EOS 'What are you crying for?' EOS inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS What _could_ the boy be crying for? EOS 'I hope you say your prayers every night,' said another gentleman in a gruff voice; 'and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you--like a Christian.' EOS The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right. EOS 'Well! EOS You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,' said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair. EOS 'So you'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o'clock,' added the surly one in the white waistcoat. EOS What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England! EOS They let the paupers go to sleep! EOS He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes. EOS And this was it:  The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered--the poor people liked it! EOS It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. EOS 'Oho!' EOS They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors' Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor! EOS There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. EOS The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people. EOS For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation. EOS It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker's bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two's gruel. EOS The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes. EOS Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more--except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides. EOS The bowls never wanted washing. EOS Boys have generally excellent appetites. EOS Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn't been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age. EOS A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist. EOS The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. EOS He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. EOS The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. EOS The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle. EOS The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said,  'Mr. EOS Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! EOS Oliver Twist has asked for more!' EOS There was a general start. EOS Horror was depicted on every countenance. EOS 'For _more_!' EOS said Mr. Limbkins. EOS Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?' EOS 'He did, sir,' replied Bumble. EOS 'That boy will be hung,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS 'I know that boy will be hung.' EOS An animated discussion took place. EOS Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish. EOS In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling. EOS 'I never was more convinced of anything in my life,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: 'I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.' EOS As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no. EOS CHAPTER III  RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE  For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board. EOS It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual's prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. EOS To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals. EOS There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver's youth and childishness. EOS He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him. EOS And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself. EOS It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing. EOS Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate. EOS said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey. EOS Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey's. EOS Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round. EOS He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again. EOS Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill. EOS Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves. EOS 'This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to 'prentis,' said Mr. Gamfield. EOS 'What of him?' EOS 'If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good 'spectable chimbley-sweepin' bisness,' said Mr. Gamfield, 'I wants a 'prentis, and I am ready to take him.' EOS 'Walk in,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS 'It's a nasty trade,' said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish. EOS 'Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,' said another gentleman. EOS Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen'l'men, and there's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em come down vith a run. EOS The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins. EOS The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words 'saving of expenditure,' 'looked well in the accounts,' 'have a printed report published,' were alone audible. EOS These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis. EOS 'Not at all,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table. EOS Mr. Gamfield's countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said,  'What'll you give, gen'l'men? EOS Come! EOS Don't be too hard on a poor man. EOS What'll you give?' EOS 'I should say, three pound ten was plenty,' said Mr. Limbkins. EOS 'Come!' EOS Say four pound, and you've got rid of him for good and all. EOS There!' EOS 'Three pound ten,' repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly. EOS 'Come! EOS I'll split the diff'erence, gen'l'men,' urged Gamfield. EOS 'Three pound fifteen.' EOS pooh! EOS nonsense!' EOS 'He'd be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. EOS Take him, you silly fellow! EOS He's just the boy for you. EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread. EOS 'A prentice, sir!' EOS said the child, trembling. EOS 'Yes, Oliver,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child's face, and he sobbed bitterly. EOS 'Come,' said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; 'Come, Oliver! EOS When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him. EOS There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. EOS Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open. EOS Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him. EOS 'This is the boy, your worship,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up. EOS 'Oh, is this the boy?' EOS 'This is him, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Bow to the magistrate, my dear.' EOS Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. EOS 'And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?' EOS inquired the old gentleman. EOS 'And this man that's to be his master--you, sir--you'll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?' EOS said the old gentleman. EOS 'When I says I will, I means I will,' replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly. EOS 'You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man,' said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver's premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. EOS But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn't reasonably be expected to discern what other people did. EOS 'I have no doubt you are, my friend,' replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand. EOS It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate. EOS If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off. EOS But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate. EOS 'My boy!' EOS said the old gentleman, 'you look pale and alarmed. EOS What is the matter?' EOS said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity. EOS 'Well! EOS of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.' EOS 'Did your worship speak to me?' EOS 'Yes. EOS Hold your tongue.' EOS A beadle ordered to hold his tongue! EOS A moral revolution! EOS 'I hope,' stammered Mr. Limbkins:  'I hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.' EOS 'The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,' said the second old gentleman sharply. EOS 'Take the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly. EOS The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. EOS This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class. EOS The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay. EOS Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker. EOS Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer. EOS His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity. EOS His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand. EOS 'You'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,' said the beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. EOS 'I say you'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,' repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane. EOS 'Think so?' EOS said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event. EOS 'The prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. EOS Bumble.' EOS 'So are the coffins,' replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in. EOS Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation. EOS 'Well, well, Mr. Bumble,' he said at length, 'there's no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. EOS A fair profit is, of course, allowable.' EOS 'Of course, of course,' replied the undertaker; 'and if I don't get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long-run, you see--he! EOS he! EOS 'Though I must say,' continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: 'though I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. EOS The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over one's calculation makes a great hole in one's profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.' EOS As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject. EOS Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme. EOS 'By the bye,' said Mr. Bumble, 'you don't know anybody who wants a boy, do you? EOS Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?' EOS As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words 'five pounds':  which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size. EOS 'Gadso!' EOS You know--dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble! EOS 'The die is the same as the porochial seal--the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man. EOS The board presented it to me on Newyear's morning, Mr. Sowerberry. EOS I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.' EOS 'I recollect,' said the undertaker. EOS 'And they made it a special verdict, I think,' said the undertaker, 'by adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had--'  'Tush! EOS interposed the beadle. EOS 'If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they'd have enough to do.' EOS 'Very true,' said the undertaker; 'they would indeed.' EOS 'Juries,' said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: 'juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.' EOS 'So they are,' said the undertaker. EOS 'No more they have,' acquiesced the undertaker. EOS 'I despise 'em,' said the beadle, growing very red in the face. EOS 'And I only wish we'd a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,' said the beadle; 'the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for 'em.' EOS 'Let 'em alone for that,' replied the undertaker. EOS So saying, he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer. EOS replied the undertaker; 'why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor's rates.' EOS 'Hem!' EOS said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Well,' replied the undertaker, 'I was thinking that if I pay so much towards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so--I think I'll take the boy myself.' EOS Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building. EOS Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening 'upon liking'--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with. EOS When little Oliver was taken before 'the gentlemen' that evening; and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a coffin-maker's; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith. EOS He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand--which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble's coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering. EOS For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. EOS 'Oliver!' EOS said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.' EOS Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor. EOS The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one. EOS Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble's he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers. EOS 'Well!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity. EOS 'Well! EOS I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--'  'So what?' EOS inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement. EOS 'So lonely, sir! EOS So very lonely!' EOS 'Everybody hates me. EOS Oh! EOS sir, don't, don't pray be cross to me!' EOS The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion's face, with tears of real agony. EOS Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about 'that troublesome cough,' bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. EOS Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence. EOS The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered. EOS 'Aha!' EOS 'No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,' replied the beadle. EOS Oliver made a bow. EOS 'Oh! EOS that's the boy, is it?' EOS 'Mrs. EOS Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?' EOS 'My dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, 'this is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.' EOS 'Dear me!' EOS said the undertaker's wife, 'he's very small.' EOS 'Why, he _is_ rather small,' replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; 'he is small. EOS 'Ah! EOS I dare say he will,' replied the lady pettishly, 'on our victuals and our drink. EOS However, men always think they know best. EOS There! EOS Get downstairs, little bag o' bones.' EOS He hasn't come home since the morning, so he may go without 'em. EOS I dare say the boy isn't too dainty to eat 'em--are you, boy?' EOS Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him. EOS I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected. EOS I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. EOS There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish. EOS 'Then come with me,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; 'your bed's under the counter. EOS But it doesn't much matter whether you do or don't, for you can't sleep anywhere else. EOS Come; don't keep me here all night!' EOS CHAPTER V  OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. EOS An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror. EOS Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets. EOS The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. EOS The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave. EOS Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. EOS He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. EOS The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him. EOS But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep. EOS Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times. EOS 'Open the door, will yer?' EOS cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door. EOS 'I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?' EOS said the voice through the key-hole. EOS 'Ten, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle. EOS He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door. EOS inquired Oliver, innocently. EOS 'Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, Work'us?' EOS said the charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity. EOS 'No, sir,' rejoined Oliver. EOS 'I'm Mister Noah Claypole,' said the charity-boy, 'and you're under me. EOS Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!' EOS It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls. EOS Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. EOS Oliver having 'caught it,' in fulfilment of Noah's prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast. EOS 'Come near the fire, Noah,' said Charlotte. EOS 'I saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master's breakfast. EOS There's your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they'll want you to mind the shop. EOS 'D'ye hear, Work'us?' EOS Why don't you let the boy alone?' EOS 'Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. EOS Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him. EOS All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. EOS he! EOS he!' EOS 'Oh, you queer soul!' EOS said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him. EOS Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. EOS No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. EOS The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of 'leathers,' 'charity,' and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. EOS But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. EOS It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy. EOS Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said,  'My dear--'  He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short. EOS 'Well,' said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply. EOS 'Nothing, my dear, nothing,' said Mr. Sowerberry. EOS said Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS 'I am nobody; don't consult me, pray. EOS _I_ don't want to intrude upon your secrets.' EOS As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences. EOS 'But, my dear,' said Sowerberry, 'I want to ask your advice.' EOS 'No, no, don't ask mine,' replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: 'ask somebody else's.' EOS This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective. EOS It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear. EOS 'There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,' resumed Mr. Sowerberry, 'which is very interesting. EOS He would make a delightful mute, my love.' EOS 'I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children's practice. EOS It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear. EOS Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry. EOS 'Aha!' EOS said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; 'an order for a coffin, eh?' EOS 'Bayton,' said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble. EOS 'I never heard the name before.' EOS Proud, too, I'm afraid, sir.' EOS 'Proud, eh?' EOS exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. EOS 'Come, that's too much.' EOS 'Antimonial, Mr. EOS Sowerberry!' EOS 'We only heard of the family the night before last,' said the beadle; 'and we shouldn't have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad. EOS He had gone out to dinner; but his 'prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent 'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.' EOS 'Ah, there's promptness,' said the undertaker. EOS 'Promptness, indeed!' EOS replied the beadle. EOS 'But what's the consequence; what's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? EOS As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation. EOS 'No, nor nobody never did; but now she's dead, we've got to bury her; and that's the direction; and the sooner it's done, the better.' EOS 'Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!' EOS 'Well,' said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, 'the sooner this job is done, the better. EOS Noah, look after the shop. EOS Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.' EOS The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along. EOS A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited. EOS The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine. EOS Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles. EOS It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. EOS The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed. EOS There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove. EOS An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. EOS There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket. EOS The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot. EOS 'Keep back! EOS 'Nonsense!' EOS She couldn't rest there. EOS The worms would worry her--not eat her--she is so worn away.' EOS The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body. EOS 'Ah!' EOS said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; 'kneel down, kneel down--kneel round her, every one of you, and mark my words! EOS I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin. EOS There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark--in the dark! EOS She couldn't even see her children's faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. EOS I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. EOS I swear it before the God that saw it! EOS He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips. EOS The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence. EOS 'She was my daughter,' said the old woman, nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. EOS Lord, Lord!--to think of it; it's as good as a play--as good as a play!' EOS As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away. EOS said the old woman in a loud whisper. EOS 'Will she be buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night? EOS I laid her out; and I must walk, you know. EOS We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! EOS Never mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. EOS she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker's coat, as he once more moved towards the door. EOS 'Yes, yes,' said the undertaker,'of course. EOS Anything you like!' EOS He disengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away. EOS The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers. EOS An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street. EOS 'Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!' EOS whispered Sowerberry in the old woman's ear; 'we are rather late; and it won't do, to keep the clergyman waiting. EOS Move on, my men,--as quick as you like!' EOS Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his master's, ran by the side. EOS There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he came. EOS So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. EOS Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper. EOS Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along. EOS Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again. EOS 'Now, Bill!' EOS said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. EOS It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. EOS The grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon. EOS 'They want to shut up the yard.' EOS 'Well, Oliver,' said Sowerberry, as they walked home, 'how do you like it?' EOS 'Pretty well, thank you, sir' replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation. EOS 'Not very much, sir.' EOS 'Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,' said Sowerberry. EOS 'Nothing when you _are_ used to it, my boy.' EOS Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. EOS But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard. EOS CHAPTER VI  OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM  The month's trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. EOS It was a nice sickly season just at this time. EOS In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience. EOS The success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. EOS The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town. EOS As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses. EOS Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. EOS It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. EOS All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration. EOS That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers. EOS Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery. EOS And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver's history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings. EOS One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist. EOS Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a 'sneak'; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was. EOS But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny. EOS 'Work'us,' said Noah, 'how's your mother?' EOS Oliver's colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying. EOS Under this impression he returned to the charge. EOS said Noah. EOS 'Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,' replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. EOS 'I think I know what it must be to die of that!' EOS 'Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work'us,' said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver's cheek. EOS 'What's set you a snivelling now?' EOS 'Not _you_,' replied Oliver, sharply. EOS Don't say anything more to me about her; you'd better not!' EOS 'Better not!' EOS exclaimed Noah. EOS 'Well! EOS Better not! EOS Work'us, don't be impudent. EOS She was a nice 'un she was. EOS Oh, Lor!' EOS 'Yer know, Work'us,' continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver's silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: 'Yer know, Work'us, it can't be helped now; and of course yer couldn't help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I'm sure we all are, and pity yer very much. EOS 'What did you say?' EOS inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly. EOS 'A regular right-down bad 'un, Work'us,' replied Noah, coolly. EOS Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the ground. EOS A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him. EOS But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. EOS His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before. EOS 'He'll murder me!' EOS Oliver's gone mad! EOS Char--lotte!' EOS And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society. EOS Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver's wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his face with the other. EOS In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind. EOS This was rather too violent exercise to last long. EOS 'Bless her, she's going off!' EOS 'Oh! EOS Charlotte,' said Mrs. Sowerberry:  speaking as well as she could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. EOS mercy indeed, ma'am,' was the reply. EOS Poor Noah! EOS 'Poor fellow!' EOS 'What's to be done!' EOS exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS 'Your master's not at home; there's not a man in the house, and he'll kick that door down in ten minutes.' EOS 'Dear, dear! EOS I don't know, ma'am,' said Charlotte, 'unless we send for the police-officers.' EOS Make haste! EOS It'll keep the swelling down.' EOS CHAPTER VII  OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY  Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. EOS 'Why, what's the matter with the boy!' EOS said the old pauper. EOS Bumble! EOS Mr. EOS cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,--which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity. EOS said Noah:  'Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--'  'What? EOS What?' EOS Not run away, sir, but he's turned wicious,' replied Noah. EOS 'He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis. EOS Oh! EOS Such agony, please, sir!' EOS When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid. EOS The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process? EOS 'It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble, 'who has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.' EOS exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. EOS 'And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?' EOS 'No! EOS he's out, or he would have murdered him,' replied Noah. EOS 'He said he wanted to.' EOS 'Ah! EOS Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?' EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Noah. EOS 'And please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him--'cause master's out.' EOS 'Certainly, my boy; certainly,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah's head, which was about three inches higher than his own. EOS 'You're a good boy--a very good boy. EOS Here's a penny for you. EOS Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your cane, and see what's best to be done. EOS 'No, I will not, sir,' replied the beadle. EOS Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. EOS Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar-door. EOS With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:  'Oliver!' EOS 'Come; you let me out!' EOS replied Oliver, from the inside. EOS said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Yes,' replied Oliver. EOS Ain't you a-trembling while I speak, sir?' EOS said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'No!' EOS He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment. EOS 'No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.' EOS 'It's Meat.' EOS 'What?' EOS exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS 'You've over-fed him, ma'am. EOS You've raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma'am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. EOS It's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies. EOS If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would never have happened.' EOS 'Dear, dear!' EOS ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: 'this comes of being liberal!' EOS The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation. EOS Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed. EOS 'Ah!' EOS Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! EOS Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.' EOS At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. EOS Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. EOS 'Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?' EOS 'He called my mother names,' replied Oliver. EOS said Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS 'She deserved what he said, and worse.' EOS 'She did,' said Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS 'It's a lie!' EOS said Oliver. EOS Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears. EOS This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. EOS If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter. EOS To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went--it was not very extensive--kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him. EOS The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. EOS It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child. EOS But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him! EOS For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. EOS The stars seemed, to the boy's eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. EOS With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. EOS He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly. EOS He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on. EOS Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. EOS His way lay directly in front of the cottage. EOS His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. EOS Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on. EOS He reached the house. EOS There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. EOS A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. EOS They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time. EOS 'Hush, Dick!' EOS said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him. EOS 'Nobody but me,' replied the child. EOS 'You musn't say you saw me, Dick,' said Oliver. EOS 'I am running away. EOS They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. EOS I don't know where. EOS 'Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b'ye to you,' replied Oliver. EOS I know I shall! EOS You will be well and happy!' EOS I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. EOS Kiss me,' said the child,  climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver's neck. EOS 'Good-b'ye, dear! EOS God bless you!' EOS The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it. EOS It was eight o'clock now. EOS Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. EOS Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live. EOS The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. EOS The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy's mind. EOS He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of. EOS It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him. EOS He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination. EOS He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle. EOS 'A clean shirt,' thought Oliver, 'is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles' walk in winter time.' EOS But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on. EOS He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before. EOS Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles. EOS He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed. EOS He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again. EOS His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. EOS Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. EOS When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind. EOS This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition. EOS In others, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady's ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. EOS The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day. EOS By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro. EOS Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. EOS He had no heart to beg. EOS And there he sat. EOS He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way. EOS He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. EOS What's the row?' EOS The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen. EOS He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man. EOS He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. EOS His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment--and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again. EOS He wore a man's coat, which reached nearly to his heels. EOS He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers. EOS 'Hullo, my covey! EOS 'I am very hungry and tired,' replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. EOS 'I have walked a long way. EOS I have been walking these seven days.' EOS 'Walking for sivin days!' EOS 'Oh, I see. EOS Beak's order, eh? EOS Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird's mouth described by the term in question. EOS 'Why, a beak's a madgst'rate; and when you walk by a beak's order, it's not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. EOS Was you never on the mill?' EOS inquired Oliver. EOS 'What mill! EOS Why, _the_ mill--the mill as takes up so little room that it'll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind's low with people, than when it's high; acos then they can't get workmen. EOS But come,' said the young gentleman; 'you want grub, and you shall have it. EOS I'm at low-water-mark myself--only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I'll fork out and stump. EOS There! EOS the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. EOS Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. EOS 'Yes.' EOS 'Money?' EOS 'No.' EOS The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go. EOS 'Do you live in London?' EOS 'Yes. EOS I do, when I'm at home,' replied the boy. EOS 'I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?' EOS 'I do, indeed,' answered Oliver. EOS 'Don't fret your eyelids on that score,' said the young gentleman. EOS 'I've got to be in London to-night; and I know a 'spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot'll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change--that is, if any genelman he knows interduces you. EOS And don't he know me? EOS Not in the least! EOS Certainly not!' EOS The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so. EOS This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time. EOS This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend's name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned. EOS As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington. EOS They crossed from the Angel into St. John's Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler's Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels. EOS Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along. EOS The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours. EOS The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main. EOS Oliver was just considering whether he hadn't better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill. EOS 'Now, then!' EOS cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger. EOS 'Plummy and slam!' EOS was the reply. EOS This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man's face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away. EOS 'Who's the t'other one?' EOS 'Yes, he's a sortin' the wipes. EOS The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared. EOS Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them. EOS There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate. EOS In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. EOS He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. EOS So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand. EOS The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance. EOS Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard--especially the one in which he held his little bundle. EOS One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed. EOS These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew's toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them. EOS 'Dodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. EOS Ah, you're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! EOS eh, my dear. EOS There are a good many of 'em, ain't there? EOS We've just looked 'em out, ready for the wash; that's all, Oliver; that's all. EOS ha! EOS ha!' EOS The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. EOS In the midst of which they went to supper. EOS Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler. EOS Oliver did as he was desired. EOS He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before. EOS Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake. EOS There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. EOS At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate. EOS He saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan's sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known. EOS When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. EOS Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. EOS He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep. EOS After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened. EOS His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. EOS 'Aha!' EOS 'Clever dogs! EOS Clever dogs! EOS Staunch to the last! EOS Never told the old parson where they were. EOS Never poached upon old Fagin! EOS It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. EOS Fine fellows! EOS Fine fellows!' EOS With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. EOS There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. EOS At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered:  'What a fine thing capital punishment is! EOS Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light. EOS Ah, it's a fine thing for the trade! EOS He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. EOS He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air. EOS 'What do you watch me for? EOS Why are you awake? EOS What have you seen? EOS Speak out, boy! EOS Quick--quick! EOS for your life. EOS 'I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.' EOS said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy. EOS 'No! EOS No, indeed!' EOS replied Oliver. EOS 'Are you sure?' EOS cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude. EOS 'I was not, indeed, sir.' EOS 'Tush, tush, my dear!' EOS said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. EOS I only tried to frighten you. EOS You're a brave boy. EOS ha! EOS you're a brave boy, Oliver.' EOS said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause. EOS 'Ah!' EOS said the Jew, turning rather pale. EOS 'They--they're mine, Oliver; my little property. EOS All I have to live upon, in my old age. EOS Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up. EOS 'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' replied the old gentleman. EOS 'Stay. EOS There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. EOS The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat. EOS 'Well,' said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, 'I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?' EOS 'Hard,' replied the Dodger. EOS 'As nails,' added Charley Bates. EOS 'Good boys, good boys!' EOS 'What have you got, Dodger?' EOS 'Lined?' EOS inquired the Jew, with eagerness. EOS 'Not so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; 'but very neat and nicely made. EOS Ingenious workman, ain't he, Oliver?' EOS said Fagin to Charley Bates. EOS You haven't marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we'll teach Oliver how to do it. EOS 'If you please, sir,' said Oliver. EOS 'You'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you, my dear?' EOS 'Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation. EOS said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour. EOS The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver's hair over his eyes, and said he'd know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? EOS When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way. EOS The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. EOS Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows. EOS All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions. EOS At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case. EOS They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. EOS They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. EOS As there is no doubt they were. EOS The visitors stopped a long time. EOS Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. EOS At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. EOS This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend. EOS 'There, my dear,' said Fagin. EOS 'Have they done work, sir?' EOS inquired Oliver. EOS Make 'em your models,' tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; 'do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters--especially the Dodger's, my dear. EOS He'll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.--Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?' EOS said the Jew, stopping short. EOS 'I never saw a sharper lad. EOS Here's a shilling for you. EOS And now come here, and I'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.' EOS But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study. EOS CHAPTER X  OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. EOS At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions. EOS Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed. EOS On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent. EOS Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger. EOS The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first. EOS The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. EOS The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction. EOS These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger. EOS They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, 'The Green': when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection. EOS 'What's the matter?' EOS demanded Oliver. EOS 'Hush!' EOS 'The old gentleman over the way?' EOS 'Yes, I see him.' EOS 'A prime plant,' observed Master Charley Bates. EOS Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed. EOS Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement. EOS The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles. EOS He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm. EOS To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed! EOS In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind. EOS He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground. EOS This was all done in a minute's space. EOS In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. EOS Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting 'Stop thief!' EOS with all his might, made off after him, book in hand. EOS But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry. EOS The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner. EOS They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting 'Stop thief!' EOS Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature. EOS If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this. EOS 'Stop thief! EOS Stop thief!' EOS There is a magic in the sound. EOS Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound. EOS 'Stop thief! EOS Stop thief!' EOS The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning. EOS Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, 'Stop thief! EOS Stop thief!' EOS 'Stop thief! EOS Stop thief!' EOS There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_ deeply implanted in the human breast. EOS 'Stop thief!' EOS A clever blow. EOS He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him:  each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse. EOS 'Stand aside!' EOS 'Give him a little air!' EOS 'Nonsense! EOS 'Where's the gentleman?' EOS 'Here his is, coming down the street.' EOS 'Make room there for the gentleman!' EOS 'Is this the boy, sir!' EOS Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers. EOS 'Afraid!' EOS murmured the crowd. EOS 'Poor fellow!' EOS said the gentleman, 'he has hurt himself.' EOS '_I_ did that, sir,' said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; 'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin' his mouth. EOS I stopped him, sir.' EOS The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself:  which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar. EOS 'Come, get up,' said the man, roughly. EOS 'It wasn't me indeed, sir. EOS 'They are here somewhere.' EOS 'Oh no, they ain't,' said the officer. EOS He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to. EOS 'Come, get up!' EOS 'Don't hurt him,' said the old gentleman, compassionately. EOS 'Come, I know you; it won't do. EOS The gentleman walked on with them by the officer's side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time. EOS The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went. EOS CHAPTER XI  TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE  The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office. EOS The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way. EOS It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand. EOS 'What's the matter now?' EOS said the man carelessly. EOS 'A young fogle-hunter,' replied the man who had Oliver in charge. EOS 'Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?' EOS 'Yes, I am,' replied the old gentleman; 'but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief. EOS I--I would rather not press the case.' EOS 'Must go before the magistrate now, sir,' replied the man. EOS This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. EOS Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up. EOS This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light. EOS But this is little. EOS In our station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges--the word is worth noting--in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. EOS Let any one who doubts this, compare the two. EOS The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock. EOS He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance. EOS _Can_ he be innocent? EOS He looked like--Bye the bye,' exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, 'Bless my soul!--where have I seen something like that look before?' EOS After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years. EOS 'No,' said the old gentleman, shaking his head; 'it must be imagination.' EOS He wandered over them again. EOS But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's features bore a trace. EOS So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book. EOS He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang. EOS Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head. EOS His face was stern, and much flushed. EOS If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages. EOS The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate's desk, said, suiting the action to the word, 'That is my name and address, sir.' EOS Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. EOS He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl. EOS 'Who are you?' EOS said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper. EOS 'My name, sir,' said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman, 'my name, sir, is Brownlow. EOS Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.' EOS Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information. EOS 'Officer!' EOS His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one. EOS 'Appears against the boy, does he?' EOS said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. EOS said Mr. Fang, peremptorily. EOS replied the old gentleman. EOS 'Hold your tongue this instant, or I'll have you turned out of the office!' EOS said Mr. Fang. EOS 'You're an insolent impertinent fellow. EOS Swear him.' EOS 'Now,' said Fang, 'what's the charge against this boy? EOS 'I was standing at a bookstall--' Mr. Brownlow began. EOS Where's the policeman? EOS Now, policeman, what is this?' EOS 'Are there any witnesses?' EOS inquired Mr. Fang. EOS 'None, your worship,' replied the policeman. EOS Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion. EOS 'Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not? EOS You have been sworn. EOS 'He has been hurt already,' said the old gentleman in conclusion. EOS yes, I dare say!' EOS said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. EOS What's your name?' EOS Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. EOS He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round. EOS 'What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?' EOS 'He says his name's Tom White, your worship,' said the kind-hearted thief-taker. EOS 'Oh, he won't speak out, won't he?' EOS said Fang. EOS 'Very well, very well. EOS Where does he live?' EOS 'Where he can, your worship,' replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver's answer. EOS At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water. EOS 'Stuff and nonsense!' EOS 'I think he really is ill, your worship,' remonstrated the officer. EOS 'Take care of him, officer,' said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; 'he'll fall down.' EOS 'Stand away, officer,' cried Fang;  'let him, if he likes.' EOS Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit. EOS The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir. EOS 'Let him lie there; he'll soon be tired of that.' EOS 'How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?' EOS inquired the clerk in a low voice. EOS 'He stands committed for three months--hard labour of course. EOS Clear the office.' EOS For Heaven's sake stop a moment!' EOS Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder. EOS 'What is this? EOS Who is this? EOS Clear the office!' EOS cried Mr. Fang. EOS 'I _will_ speak,' cried the man; 'I will not be turned out. EOS I keep the book-stall. EOS Mr. Fang, you must hear me. EOS You must not refuse, sir.' EOS The man was right. EOS His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up. EOS 'This,' said the man:  'I saw three boys:  two others and the prisoner here:  loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading. EOS The robbery was committed by another boy. EOS Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery. EOS 'Why didn't you come here before?' EOS 'I hadn't a soul to mind the shop,' replied the man. EOS I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I've run here all the way.' EOS 'The prosecutor was reading, was he?' EOS inquired Fang, after another pause. EOS 'Yes,' replied the man. EOS said Fang. EOS 'No, it is not,' replied the man, with a smile. EOS exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently. EOS 'A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!' EOS 'I consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. EOS Clear the office!' EOS 'D--n me!' EOS I'll--'  'Clear the office!' EOS 'Officers, do you hear? EOS Clear the office!' EOS The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other:  in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. EOS He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment. EOS Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame. EOS 'Poor boy, poor boy!' EOS said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. EOS 'Call a coach, somebody, pray. EOS said the book-stall keeper, looking in. EOS 'Bless me, yes, my dear sir,' said Mr. Brownlow quickly. EOS 'I forgot you. EOS Jump in. EOS There's no time to lose.' EOS The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove. EOS CHAPTER XII  IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. EOS AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS. EOS The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville. EOS The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame. EOS Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream. EOS Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around. EOS 'What room is this? EOS Where have I been brought to?' EOS said Oliver. EOS 'This is not the place I went to sleep in.' EOS He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once. EOS 'You must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh. EOS Lie down again; there's a dear!' EOS With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck. EOS 'What a grateful little dear it is. EOS What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!' EOS I almost feel as if she had.' EOS But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died. EOS She can't know anything about me though,' added Oliver after a moment's silence. EOS 'If she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.' EOS The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again. EOS 'You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?' EOS 'Yes,  I know you are,' said the gentleman:  'You're hungry too, an't you?' EOS 'Hem!' EOS said the gentleman. EOS He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the gentleman:  looking very wise. EOS 'You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?' EOS said the doctor. EOS 'No, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'No,' said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. EOS 'You're not sleepy. EOS Nor thirsty. EOS Are you?' EOS 'Yes, sir, rather thirsty,' answered Oliver. EOS 'Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the doctor. EOS 'It's very natural that he should be thirsty. EOS You may give him a little tea, ma'am, and some dry toast without any butter. EOS The old lady dropped a curtsey. EOS Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o'clock. EOS The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come:  bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap. EOS Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings. EOS Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. EOS Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past! EOS He belonged to the world again. EOS 'Never mind me, my dear,' said the old lady; 'I'm only having a regular good cry. EOS There; it's all over now; and I'm quite comfortable.' EOS 'Well, never you mind that, my dear,' said the old lady; 'that's got nothing to do with your broth; and it's full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he'll be pleased.' EOS 'Are you fond of pictures, dear?' EOS inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair. EOS 'I don't quite know, ma'am,' said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the canvas; 'I have seen so few that I hardly know. EOS said the old lady, 'painters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child. EOS The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it's a deal too honest. EOS 'Is--is that a likeness, ma'am?' EOS 'Whose, ma'am?' EOS asked Oliver. EOS It seems to strike your fancy, dear.' EOS 'It is so pretty,' replied Oliver. EOS said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting. EOS 'Oh no, no,' returned Oliver quickly; 'but the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. EOS exclaimed the old lady, starting; 'don't talk in that way, child. EOS You're weak and nervous after your illness. EOS Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won't see it. EOS There!' EOS Oliver _did_ see it in his mind's eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation. EOS He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door. EOS 'Come in,' said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow. EOS Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain. EOS 'I'm rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. EOS 'Everything you have had, has been well aired, sir.' EOS I don't know,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind that. EOS How do you feel, my dear?' EOS 'Very happy, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'Good by,' said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. EOS 'Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? EOS 'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin:  drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word:  to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever. EOS 'Ugh!' EOS said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; 'a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. EOS Wouldn't they, Tom White, eh?' EOS 'Oliver,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'Oliver what? EOS 'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.' EOS 'Queer name!' EOS 'What made you tell the magistrate your name was White?' EOS This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver's face. EOS It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments. EOS But, although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze. EOS 'No, no,' replied the old gentleman. EOS 'Why! EOS what's this? EOS Bedwin, look there!' EOS As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver's head, and then to the boy's face. EOS There was its living copy. EOS The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy! EOS Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. EOS A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording--  That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow's personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions:  the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to matters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. EOS Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case. EOS It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway. EOS Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth. EOS 'What's the matter?' EOS inquired the Dodger. EOS 'Ha! EOS ha!' EOS roared Charley Bates. EOS 'Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?' EOS 'I can't help it,' said Charley, 'I can't help it! EOS To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again' the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him--oh, my eye!' EOS The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours. EOS 'What'll Fagin say?' EOS repeated Charley Bates. EOS 'Ah, what?' EOS 'What should he say?' EOS Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, scratched his head, and nodded thrice. EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS said Charley. EOS 'Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn't, and high cockolorum,' said the Dodger:  with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance. EOS This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. EOS The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. EOS There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened. EOS 'Why, how's this?' EOS They can't have got into trouble. EOS Hark!' EOS The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. EOS said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. EOS 'Speak out, or I'll throttle you!' EOS Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar--something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet. EOS 'Will you speak?' EOS thundered the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous. EOS 'Why, the traps have got him, and that's all about it,' said the Dodger, sullenly. EOS And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced. EOS But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman. EOS 'Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!' EOS growled a deep voice. EOS 'Who pitched that 'ere at me? EOS I might have know'd, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water--and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter. EOS Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master! EOS 'Why didn't you come in afore?' EOS said the man. EOS 'You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you? EOS Lie down!' EOS This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room. EOS 'What are you up to? EOS Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?' EOS said the man, seating himself deliberately. EOS I would if I was them. EOS If I'd been your 'prentice, I'd have done it long ago, and--no, I couldn't have sold you afterwards, for you're fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don't blow glass bottles large enough.' EOS 'Hush! EOS hush! EOS Mr. Sikes,' said the Jew, trembling; 'don't speak so loud!' EOS You know my name:  out with it! EOS I shan't disgrace it when the time comes.' EOS 'Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,' said the Jew, with abject humility. EOS 'You seem out of humour, Bill.' EOS 'Perhaps I am,' replied Sikes; 'I should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and--'  'Are you mad?' EOS Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. EOS This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller's ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman's merry heart. EOS After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances. EOS 'I'm afraid,' said the Jew, 'that he may say something which will get us into trouble.' EOS 'That's very likely,' returned Sikes with a malicious grin. EOS 'And I'm afraid, you see,' added the Jew, speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,--'I'm afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.' EOS The man started, and turned round upon the Jew. EOS But the old gentleman's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall. EOS Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out. EOS 'Somebody must find out wot's been done at the office,' said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in. EOS 'If he hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till he comes out again,' said Mr. Sikes, 'and then he must be taken care on. EOS You must get hold of him somehow.' EOS Again the Jew nodded. EOS The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted. EOS It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh. EOS said the Jew. EOS 'Bet will go; won't you, my dear?' EOS 'Wheres?' EOS 'Only just up to the office, my dear,' said the Jew coaxingly. EOS It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be 'blessed' if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal. EOS He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers, to the other female. EOS 'That it won't do; so it's no use a-trying it on, Fagin,' replied Nancy. EOS 'What I say, Bill,' replied the lady collectedly. EOS 'She'll go, Fagin,' said Sikes. EOS 'Yes, she will, Fagin,' said Sikes. EOS And Mr. Sikes was right. EOS She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances. EOS 'Stop a minute, my dear,' said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket. EOS 'Carry that in one hand. EOS It looks more respectable, my dear.' EOS 'Give her a door-key to carry in her t'other one, Fagin,' said Sikes; 'it looks real and genivine like.' EOS 'Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a large street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand. EOS 'There; very good! EOS Very good indeed, my dear!' EOS said the Jew, rubbing his hands. EOS 'Oh, my brother! EOS My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!' EOS exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress. EOS 'What has become of him! EOS Where have they taken him to! EOS 'She's a honour to her sex,' said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist. EOS While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards. EOS Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell-doors, and listened. EOS There was no sound within:  so she coughed and listened again. EOS Still there was no reply:  so she spoke. EOS 'Nolly, dear?' EOS There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument. EOS 'Well!' EOS cried a faint and feeble voice. EOS 'Is there a little boy here?' EOS inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob. EOS This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_ playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood. EOS In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp-office. EOS But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother. EOS 'I haven't got him, my dear,' said the old man. EOS 'Where is he?' EOS screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner. EOS 'What gentleman! EOS Oh, gracious heavens! EOS What gentleman?' EOS exclaimed Nancy. EOS In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence:  of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman. EOS Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning. EOS 'We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,' said the Jew greatly excited. EOS 'Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him! EOS Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. EOS I trust to you, my dear,--to you and the Artful for everything! EOS Stay, stay,' added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; 'there's money, my dears. EOS You'll know where to find me! EOS With these words, he pushed them from the room:  and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver. EOS Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing. EOS A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. EOS 'Who's there?' EOS 'Me!' EOS replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole. EOS 'What now?' EOS inquired the Dodger. EOS 'Yes,' replied the Jew, 'wherever she lays hands on him. EOS I shall know what to do next; never fear.' EOS The boy murmured a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs after his companions. EOS CHAPTER XIV  COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW'S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND  Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow's abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no reference to Oliver's history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him. EOS He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady. EOS His expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed. EOS said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes. EOS 'It is gone, you see.' EOS 'I see it is ma'am,' replied Oliver. EOS 'Why have they taken it away?' EOS 'It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,' rejoined the old lady. EOS 'Oh, no, indeed. EOS 'I liked to see it. EOS said the old lady, good-humouredly; 'you get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. EOS There! EOS I promise you that! EOS Now, let us talk about something else.' EOS This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time. EOS When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! EOS They were happy days, those of Oliver's recovery. EOS He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. EOS This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again. EOS One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while. EOS 'Bless us, and save us! EOS Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,' said Mrs. Bedwin. EOS If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!' EOS Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. EOS On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens. EOS There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading. EOS When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down. EOS Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser. EOS Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives. EOS said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling. EOS 'A great number, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'I never saw so many.' EOS 'Not always those,' said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; 'there are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size. EOS How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?' EOS 'I think I would rather read them, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'What! EOS said the old gentleman. EOS Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing. EOS Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was. EOS 'Well, well,' said the old gentleman, composing his features. EOS 'Don't be afraid! EOS At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to. EOS I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.' EOS 'Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!' EOS Let me stay here, and be a servant. EOS Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!' EOS 'My dear child,' said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver's sudden appeal; 'you need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.' EOS 'I never, never will, sir,' interposed Oliver. EOS 'I hope not,' rejoined the old gentleman. EOS 'I do not think you ever will. EOS I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself. EOS As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still. EOS 'Well, well!' EOS said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, 'I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again. EOS You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement. EOS Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.' EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied the servant. EOS 'Shall I go downstairs, sir?' EOS A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it. EOS The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description. EOS 'Look here! EOS do you see this! EOS Isn't it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase? EOS This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder. EOS 'Hallo! EOS 'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?' EOS said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. EOS 'Wait a minute! EOS Don't speak! EOS 'I feel strongly on this subject, sir,' said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his gloves. EOS 'There's always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it's put there by the surgeon's boy at the corner. EOS A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light. EOS "Don't go to him," I called out of the window, "he's an assassin! EOS So he is. EOS Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again. EOS 'That's the boy, is it?' EOS said Mr. Grimwig, at length. EOS 'That's the boy,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'How are you, boy?' EOS inquired Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'I don't know,' replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly. EOS I never see any difference in boys. EOS I only knew two sort of boys. EOS Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.' EOS 'And which is Oliver?' EOS 'Mealy. EOS The wretch!' EOS 'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath.' EOS 'They are not,' replied Mr. Grimwig. EOS Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight. EOS 'Where does he come from! EOS What is he? EOS He has had a fever. EOS What of that? EOS Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? EOS Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven't they, eh? EOS I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master. EOS nonsense!' EOS Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend. EOS 'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?' EOS 'To-morrow morning,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS He answered with some hesitation, because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard at him. EOS 'I'll tell you what,' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; 'he won't come up to you to-morrow morning. EOS I saw him hesitate. EOS 'If he is not,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'I'll--' and down went the stick. EOS 'I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!' EOS rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the table also. EOS 'Stop the boy, Mrs. EOS Bedwin!' EOS said Mr. Brownlow; 'there is something to go back.' EOS 'He has gone, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin. EOS He is a poor man, and they are not paid for. EOS There are some books to be taken back, too.' EOS The street-door was opened. EOS Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight. EOS Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him. EOS 'Dear me, I am very sorry for that,' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; 'I particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.' EOS The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions:  on this head at least:  at once. EOS 'You _shall_ go, my dear,' said the old gentleman. EOS 'The books are on a chair by my table. EOS Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take. EOS 'You are to say,' said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; 'you are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. EOS 'I won't be ten minutes, sir,' said Oliver, eagerly. EOS Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. EOS Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street:  all of which Oliver said he clearly understood. EOS Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart. EOS 'I can't bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.' EOS At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner. EOS 'Let me see; he'll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,' said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. EOS 'It will be dark by that time.' EOS 'Don't you?' EOS asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling. EOS The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend's confident smile. EOS 'No,' he said, smiting the table with his fist, 'I do not. EOS He'll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. EOS With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them. EOS It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back. EOS It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them. EOS CHAPTER XV  SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE  In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. EOS At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict. EOS 'Keep quiet, you warmint! EOS Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration. EOS Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head. EOS 'You would, would you?' EOS 'Come here, you born devil! EOS D'ye hear?' EOS The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before:  at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast. EOS The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands. EOS Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's participation, at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer. EOS 'What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?' EOS said Sikes, with a fierce gesture. EOS 'I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,' replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer. EOS 'Didn't know, you white-livered thief!' EOS growled Sikes. EOS 'Couldn't you hear the noise?' EOS 'Oh no! EOS 'Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! EOS I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.' EOS 'Why?' EOS inquired the Jew with a forced smile. EOS The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. EOS He was obviously very ill at ease, however. EOS 'Grin away,' said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; 'grin away. EOS I've got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d--me, I'll keep it. EOS 'Well, what have you got to say to me?' EOS 'It's all passed safe through the melting-pot,' replied Fagin, 'and this is your share. EOS It's rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you'll do me a good turn another time, and--'  'Stow that gammon,' interposed the robber, impatiently. EOS 'Where is it? EOS Hand over!' EOS 'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew, soothingly. EOS 'Here it is! EOS 'This is all, is it?' EOS 'Don't put on an injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. EOS These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. EOS It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance. EOS It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn. EOS inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth. EOS 'Where? EOS Strike me blind, if I don't honour that 'ere girl, for her native talents.' EOS 'Send her here.' EOS 'Yes, I am, Bill,' replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; 'and tired enough of it I am, too. EOS The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. EOS In about ten minutes' time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go. EOS Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight. EOS Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book-stall. EOS He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. EOS 'Oh, my dear brother!' EOS 'Don't,' cried Oliver, struggling. EOS 'Let go of me. EOS 'Oh my gracious!' EOS Oliver! EOS Oliver! EOS Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! EOS Oh, I've found him. EOS 'Young wretch!' EOS 'Go home, do, you little brute,' said the other. EOS 'I am not,' replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. EOS I'm an orphan; I live at Pentonville.' EOS exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment. EOS cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. EOS 'He can't help himself. EOS Make him come home, there's good people, or he'll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!' EOS 'What the devil's this?' EOS Come home to your poor mother, you young dog! EOS Come home directly.' EOS 'I don't belong to them. EOS I don't know them. EOS 'Yes; I'll help you, you young rascal! EOS What books are these? EOS You've been a stealing 'em, have you? EOS With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head. EOS 'That's the only way of bringing him to his senses!' EOS 'To be sure!' EOS cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret-window. EOS said the two women. EOS 'And he shall have it, too!' EOS 'Come on, you young villain! EOS Here, Bull's-eye, mind him, boy! EOS Mind him!' EOS Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. EOS In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. EOS CHAPTER XVI  RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY  The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market. EOS Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. EOS growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round. EOS 'Here, Bull's-Eye!' EOS The dog looked up, and growled. EOS 'See here, boy!' EOS said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver's throat; 'if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! EOS D'ye mind!' EOS The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay. EOS 'He's as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn't!' EOS 'Now, you know what you've got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game. EOS Get on, young'un!' EOS Bull's-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward. EOS It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. EOS The night was dark and foggy. EOS The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver's eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing. EOS They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour. EOS With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded. EOS 'Eight o' clock, Bill,' said Nancy, when the bell ceased. EOS replied Sikes. EOS 'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,' said Nancy. EOS Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.' EOS 'Poor fellow!' EOS 'Yes; that's all you women think of,' answered Sikes. EOS 'Fine young chaps! EOS Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.' EOS With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him to step out again. EOS 'Wait a minute!' EOS said the girl:  'I wouldn't hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o'clock struck, Bill. EOS 'Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me. EOS Come on, and don't stand preaching there.' EOS But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white. EOS They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. EOS 'All right,' cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about. EOS Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. EOS They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp. EOS Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house. EOS The passage was perfectly dark. EOS 'Anybody here?' EOS inquired Sikes. EOS 'No,' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before. EOS asked the robber. EOS Oh, no!' EOS The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver's ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness. EOS Look after your legs if you do!' EOS 'Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one,' replied the voice. EOS The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. EOS He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick. EOS The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. EOS They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter. EOS 'Oh, my wig, my wig!' EOS cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded:  'here he is! EOS Oh, Fagin, look at him! EOS Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.' EOS With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy. EOS The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver's pockets with steady assiduity. EOS 'Look at his togs, Fagin!' EOS said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. EOS Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! EOS And his books, too! EOS Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!' EOS 'The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. EOS Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you were coming? EOS At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment. EOS 'Hallo, what's that?' EOS 'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew. EOS 'Mine, Bill, mine. EOS You shall have the books.' EOS 'If that ain't mine!' EOS The Jew started. EOS Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back. EOS 'Come! EOS Hand over, will you?' EOS said Sikes. EOS 'This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?' EOS inquired the Jew. EOS Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!' EOS With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew's finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief. EOS 'That's for our share of the trouble,' said Sikes; 'and not half enough, neither. EOS You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading. EOS If you ain't, sell 'em.' EOS At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first. EOS 'They belong to the old gentleman,' said Oliver, wringing his hands; 'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. EOS Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back. EOS He'll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. EOS With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation. EOS 'The boy's right,' remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. EOS Ha! EOS ha!' EOS chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, 'it couldn't have happened better, if we had chosen our time!' EOS 'Of course it couldn't,' replied Sikes; 'I know'd that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. EOS It's all right enough. EOS They're soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn't have taken him in at all; and they'll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. EOS He's safe enough.' EOS Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room:  uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof. EOS 'Keep back the dog, Bill!' EOS 'Keep back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces.' EOS 'Serve him right!' EOS cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl's grasp. EOS 'Shan't he!' EOS said Sikes, setting his teeth. EOS 'I'll soon do that, if you don't keep off.' EOS 'What's the matter here!' EOS 'The girl's gone mad, I think,' replied Sikes, savagely. EOS 'Then keep quiet, will you?' EOS said the Jew, with a threatening look. EOS 'No, I won't do that, neither,' replied Nancy, speaking very loud. EOS 'Come! EOS With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver. EOS said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?' EOS sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. EOS The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. EOS She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room. EOS 'I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin,' cried the girl. EOS 'You've got the boy, and what more would you have?--Let him be--let him be--or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.' EOS The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself. EOS 'Why, Nancy!' EOS said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; 'you,--you're more clever than ever to-night. EOS ha! EOS my dear, you are acting beautifully.' EOS said the girl. EOS 'Take care I don't overdo it. EOS You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.' EOS The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue. EOS As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments. EOS 'What do you mean by this?' EOS Burn my body! EOS Do you know who you are, and what you are?' EOS 'Well, then, keep quiet,' rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, 'or I'll quiet you for a good long time to come.' EOS The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came. EOS 'God Almighty help me, I am!' EOS cried the girl passionately; 'and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here. EOS Isn't that enough for the old wretch, without blows?' EOS 'Civil words, you villain! EOS pointing to Oliver. EOS 'I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. EOS Don't you know it? EOS Speak out! EOS 'It is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you're the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that'll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!' EOS The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted. EOS 'She's all right now,' said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. EOS 'She's uncommon strong in the arms, when she's up in this way.' EOS 'It's the worst of having to do with women,' said the Jew, replacing his club; 'but they're clever, and we can't get on, in our line, without 'em. EOS 'I suppose he'd better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?' EOS Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow's; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his whereabout. EOS 'Put off the smart ones,' said Charley, 'and I'll give 'em to Fagin to take care of. EOS What fun it is!' EOS Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. EOS Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him. EOS The noise of Charley's laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed. EOS But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep. EOS CHAPTER XVII  OLIVER'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION  It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. EOS We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually. EOS Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight. EOS The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous. EOS If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition. EOS Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. EOS Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual. EOS There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle's mind, too great for utterance. EOS Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. EOS said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate. EOS 'If it isn't him at this time in the morning! EOS Well, dear me, it IS a pleasure, this is! EOS Come into the parlour, sir, please.' EOS The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house. EOS Mann,' said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; 'Mrs. EOS Mann, ma'am, good morning.' EOS 'Well, and good morning to _you_, sir,' replied Mrs. Mann, with many smiles; 'and hoping you find yourself well, sir!' EOS 'So-so, Mrs. Mann,' replied the beadle. EOS 'A porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs. EOS 'Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble,' rejoined the lady. EOS And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety, if they had heard it. EOS 'A porochial life, ma'am,' continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with his cane, 'is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.' EOS You may well sigh, Mrs. EOS Mann!' EOS Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again:  evidently to the satisfaction of the public character:  who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,  'Mrs. EOS Mann, I am going to London.' EOS 'Lauk, Mr. EOS Bumble!' EOS cried Mrs. Mann, starting back. EOS 'To London, ma'am,' resumed the inflexible beadle, 'by coach. EOS I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann! EOS A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and the board has appointed me--me, Mrs. Mann--to dispose to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell. EOS And I very much question,' added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, 'whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.' EOS you mustn't be too hard upon them, sir,' said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly. EOS 'The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble; 'and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.' EOS At length she said,  'You're going by coach, sir? EOS I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.' EOS 'We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.' EOS 'Oh!' EOS said Mrs. Mann. EOS 'The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'They are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move 'em than to bury 'em--that is, if we can throw 'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don't die upon the road to spite us. EOS Ha! EOS ha!' EOS When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave. EOS 'We are forgetting business, ma'am,' said the beadle; 'here is your porochial stipend for the month.' EOS 'It's very much blotted, sir,' said the farmer of infants; 'but it's formal enough, I dare say. EOS Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I'm sure.' EOS Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann's curtsey; and inquired how the children were. EOS 'Bless their dear little hearts!' EOS Of course, except the two that died last week. EOS And little Dick.' EOS 'Isn't that boy no better?' EOS inquired Mr. Bumble. EOS Mrs. Mann shook her head. EOS 'He's a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,' said Mr. Bumble angrily. EOS 'Where is he?' EOS 'I'll bring him to you in one minute, sir,' replied Mrs. Mann. EOS After some calling, Dick was discovered. EOS The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright. EOS Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle's voice. EOS 'Can't you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?' EOS The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble. EOS 'What's the matter with you, porochial Dick?' EOS inquired Mr. Bumble, with well-timed jocularity. EOS 'Nothing, sir,' replied the child faintly. EOS 'I should think not,' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble's humour. EOS 'You want for nothing, I'm sure.' EOS 'I should like--' faltered the child. EOS 'Hey-day!' EOS interposed Mr. Mann, 'I suppose you're going to say that you DO want for something, now? EOS said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of authority. EOS 'Like what, sir, eh?' EOS 'Why, what does the boy mean?' EOS 'What do you mean, sir?' EOS Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, 'They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann. EOS 'I couldn't have believed it, sir' said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. EOS 'I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my fault, sir?' EOS 'They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. EOS Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey. EOS At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it:  took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London. EOS Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. EOS The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.' EOS And then followed a full description of Oliver's dress, person, appearance, and disappearance:  with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length. EOS To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of 'I don't know; where do you come from?' EOS Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state. EOS I knew we should! EOS I was certain of it. EOS Bless his heart! EOS I said so all along.' EOS Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. EOS The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did. EOS He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. EOS A parish beadle, or I'll eat my head.' EOS 'Take a seat, will you?' EOS Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig's manner. EOS Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle's countenance; and said, with a little impatience,  'Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?' EOS 'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'And you ARE a beadle, are you not?' EOS 'I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly. EOS A beadle all over!' EOS Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed:  'Do you know where this poor boy is now?' EOS 'No more than nobody,' replied Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Well, what DO you know of him?' EOS 'Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say. EOS What DO you know of him?' EOS 'You see?' EOS Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble's pursed-up countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible. EOS Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments' reflection, commenced his story. EOS It would be tedious if given in the beadle's words:  occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents. EOS That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice. EOS That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from his master's house. EOS Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow's observations. EOS 'I fear it is all too true,' said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers. EOS It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew. EOS At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently. EOS Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; 'that boy, Oliver, is an imposter.' EOS 'It can't be, sir. EOS It cannot be,' said the old lady energetically. EOS 'I tell you he is,' retorted the old gentleman. EOS 'What do you mean by can't be? EOS 'I never will believe it, sir,' replied the old lady, firmly. EOS 'Never!' EOS Bah!' EOS 'He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,' retorted Mrs. Bedwin, indignantly. EOS 'I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can't say the same, shouldn't say anything about them. EOS That's my opinion!' EOS 'Silence!' EOS said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from feeling. EOS Never. EOS Never, on any pretence, mind! EOS You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin. EOS Remember! EOS There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow's that night. EOS Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning. EOS Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select friends. EOS Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation. EOS Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew's words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. EOS That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind. EOS The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet. EOS Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the room-door behind him. EOS Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed. EOS After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house. EOS The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways. EOS From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and dreary as it looked now. EOS Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. EOS In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed:  the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. EOS There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends. EOS One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway. EOS The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots. EOS Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature. EOS He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:  'What a pity it is he isn't a prig!' EOS 'Ah!' EOS said Master Charles Bates; 'he don't know what's good for him.' EOS The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates. EOS They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence. EOS 'I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?' EOS 'It's a the--; you're one, are you not?' EOS 'I'd scorn to be anything else.' EOS Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary. EOS So's Fagin. EOS So's Bet. EOS So we all are, down to the dog. EOS And he's the downiest one of the lot!' EOS 'And the least given to peaching,' added Charley Bates. EOS 'He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight,' said the Dodger. EOS 'Not a bit of it,' observed Charley. EOS 'He's a rum dog. EOS Don't he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he's in company!' EOS pursued the Dodger. EOS And don't he hate other dogs as ain't of his breed! EOS Oh, no!' EOS 'He's an out-and-out Christian,' said Charley. EOS 'This hasn't go anything to do with young Green here.' EOS 'No more it has,' said Charley. EOS 'Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?' EOS 'And make your fortun' out of hand?' EOS 'And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,' said Charley Bates. EOS 'I don't like it,' rejoined Oliver, timidly; 'I wish they would let me go. EOS I--I--would rather go.' EOS rejoined Charley. EOS 'Go!' EOS '_I_ couldn't do it,' said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust. EOS 'Look here!' EOS said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence. EOS 'Here's a jolly life! EOS What's the odds where it comes from? EOS Here, catch hold; there's plenty more where they were took from. EOS You won't, won't you? EOS Oh, you precious flat!' EOS 'It's naughty, ain't it, Oliver?' EOS inquired Charley Bates. EOS 'He'll come to be scragged, won't he?' EOS 'I don't know what that means,' replied Oliver. EOS 'Something in this way, old feller,' said Charly. EOS As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing. EOS 'That's what it means,' said Charley. EOS I never did see such prime company as that 'ere boy; he'll be the death of me, I know he will.' EOS 'Fagin will make something of you, though, or you'll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable. EOS 'And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,' said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, 'if you don't take fogels and tickers--'  'What's the good of talking in that way?' EOS interposed Master Bates; 'he don't know what you mean.' EOS 'If you don't take pocket-handkechers and watches,' said the Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver's capacity, 'some other cove will; so that the coves that lose 'em will be all the worse, and you'll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha'p'orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them--and you've just as good a right to them as they have.' EOS 'It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger's word for it. EOS The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the Dodger's reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil's proficiency. EOS Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements. EOS The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful. EOS Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he 'wished he might be busted if he warn't as dry as a lime-basket.' EOS 'I--I--don't know, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'Who's that?' EOS inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver. EOS 'A young friend of mine, my dear,' replied the Jew. EOS 'Never mind where I came from, young 'un; you'll find your way there, soon enough, I'll bet a crown!' EOS After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew. EOS After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers. EOS These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself. EOS From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver's, Mr. Fagin best knew. EOS At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days:  mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings. EOS In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. EOS CHAPTER XIX  IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON  It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den. EOS The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. EOS As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal. EOS He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter. EOS The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way. EOS At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs. EOS 'Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,' said the Jew looking in. EOS 'Bring in your body then,' said Sikes. EOS Don't you know the devil when he's got a great-coat on?' EOS Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen:  wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be. EOS 'Well!' EOS Nancy.' EOS The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. EOS 'It seems to go right through one,' added the old man, touching his side. EOS 'It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,' said Mr. Sikes. EOS It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.' EOS Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many:  which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids. EOS 'Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,' replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it. EOS 'What! EOS inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. EOS 'Ugh!' EOS With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself:  which he did at once. EOS It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a 'life-preserver' that hung over the chimney-piece. EOS 'Now I'm ready.' EOS 'For business?' EOS inquired the Jew. EOS 'For business,' replied Sikes; 'so say what you've got to say.' EOS 'About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?' EOS said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice. EOS Wot about it?' EOS 'Ah! EOS you know what I mean, my dear,' said the Jew. EOS 'He knows what I mean, Nancy; don't he?' EOS 'No, he don't,' sneered Mr. Sikes. EOS 'Or he won't, and that's the same thing. EOS Speak out, and call things by their right names; don't sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn't the very first that thought about the robbery. EOS Wot d'ye mean?' EOS 'Hush, Bill, hush!' EOS said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; 'somebody will hear us, my dear. EOS said Sikes; 'I don't care.' EOS But as Mr. Sikes DID care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer. EOS 'There, there,' said the Jew, coaxingly. EOS 'It was only my caution, nothing more. EOS Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh? EOS Such plate, my dear, such plate!' EOS said the Jew:  rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation. EOS 'Not at all,' replied Sikes coldly. EOS 'No, not at all,' rejoined Sikes. EOS 'At least it can't be a put-up job, as we expected.' EOS 'Don't tell me!' EOS 'But I will tell you,' retorted Sikes. EOS 'Who are you that's not to be told? EOS I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can't get one of the servants in line.' EOS 'Do you mean to tell me, Bill,' said the Jew: softening as the other grew heated:  'that neither of the two men in the house can be got over?' EOS 'Yes, I do mean to tell you so,' replied Sikes. EOS 'The old lady has had 'em these twenty years; and if you were to give 'em five hundred pound, they wouldn't be in it.' EOS 'But do you mean to say, my dear,' remonstrated the Jew, 'that the women can't be got over?' EOS 'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes. EOS 'Not by flash Toby Crackit?' EOS said the Jew incredulously. EOS 'Think what women are, Bill,'  'No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,' replied Sikes. EOS 'He says he's worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he's been loitering down there, and it's all of no use.' EOS The Jew looked blank at this information. EOS After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up. EOS 'So it is,' said Mr. Sikes. EOS 'Worse luck!' EOS Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time. EOS 'Is it a bargain?' EOS Toby and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters. EOS The crib's barred up at night like a jail; but there's one part we can crack, safe and softly.' EOS asked the Jew eagerly. EOS 'Why,' whispered Sikes, 'as you cross the lawn--'  'Yes?' EOS said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it. EOS cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's face. EOS 'Never mind which part it is. EOS You can't do it without me, I know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.' EOS 'As you like, my dear, as you like' replied the Jew. EOS 'Is there no help wanted, but yours and Toby's?' EOS 'None,' said Sikes. EOS 'Cept a centre-bit and a boy. EOS The first we've both got; the second you must find us.' EOS 'A boy!' EOS exclaimed the Jew. EOS then it's a panel, eh?' EOS 'Never mind wot it is!' EOS replied Sikes. EOS 'I want a boy, and he musn't be a big 'un. EOS Lord!' EOS said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, 'if I'd only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's! EOS He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job. EOS But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a 'prentice of him. EOS 'No more we should,' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. EOS 'Bill!' EOS 'What now?' EOS inquired Sikes. EOS Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer. EOS 'You don't want any beer,' said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her seat very composedly. EOS replied Sikes. EOS 'Nonsense,' rejoined the girl coolly, 'Go on, Fagin. EOS I know what he's going to say, Bill; he needn't mind me.' EOS The Jew still hesitated. EOS Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise. EOS 'Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?' EOS She ain't one to blab. EOS Are you Nancy?' EOS '_I_ should think not!' EOS replied the young lady:  drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it. EOS 'No, no, my dear, I know you're not,' said the Jew; 'but--' and again the old man paused. EOS 'But wot?' EOS At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of 'Keep the game a-going!' EOS These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise. EOS 'Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh. EOS 'Tell Bill at once, about Oliver!' EOS said the Jew, patting her on the neck. EOS 'It WAS about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS 'He's the boy for you, my dear,' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully. EOS 'He!' EOS said Nancy. EOS 'He's been in good training these last few weeks, and it's time he began to work for his bread. EOS Besides, the others are all too big.' EOS 'Well, he is just the size I want,' said Mr. Sikes, ruminating. EOS 'And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,' interposed the Jew; 'he can't help himself. EOS That is, if you frighten him enough.' EOS 'Frighten him!' EOS echoed Sikes. EOS 'It'll be no sham frightening, mind you. EOS You won't see him alive again, Fagin. EOS said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead. EOS 'I've thought of it all,' said the Jew with energy. EOS 'I've--I've had my eye upon him, my dears, close--close. EOS Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he's ours! EOS Oho! EOS The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy. EOS 'Ours!' EOS said Sikes. EOS 'Yours, you mean.' EOS 'Perhaps I do, my dear,' said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. EOS 'Because they're of no use to me, my dear,' replied the Jew, with some confusion, 'not worth the taking. EOS With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn't with twenty of them. EOS Never mind how he came there; it's quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that's all I want. EOS Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way--which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.' EOS 'When is it to be done?' EOS asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin's affectation of humanity. EOS 'Ah, to be sure,' said the Jew; 'when is it to be done, Bill?' EOS 'Good,' said the Jew; 'there's no moon.' EOS 'No,' rejoined Sikes. EOS asked the Jew. EOS Sikes nodded. EOS 'And about--'  'Oh, ah, it's all planned,' rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. EOS 'Never mind particulars. EOS I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. EOS Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that's all you'll have to do.' EOS After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else. EOS It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit. EOS These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations. EOS At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell. EOS 'Good-night, Nancy,' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before. EOS Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. EOS There was no flinching about the girl. EOS The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs. EOS ha! EOS Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode:  where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return. EOS 'Here he is!' EOS 'Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away. EOS 'To-morrow. EOS CHAPTER XX  WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES  When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. EOS 'To--to--stop there, sir?' EOS asked Oliver, anxiously. EOS 'No, no, my dear. EOS Not to stop there,' replied the Jew. EOS 'We shouldn't like to lose you. EOS Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again. EOS ha! EOS We won't be so cruel as to send you away, my dear. EOS The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could. EOS Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know. EOS 'Why, do you think?' EOS inquired Fagin, parrying the question. EOS 'Bah!' EOS said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy's face. EOS 'You may burn a candle,' said the Jew, putting one upon the table. EOS 'And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you. EOS Good-night!' EOS 'Good-night!' EOS replied Oliver, softly. EOS Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name. EOS Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it. EOS He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room. EOS 'Take heed, Oliver! EOS take heed!' EOS said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner. EOS 'He's a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up. EOS Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he bids you. EOS Mind!' EOS Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room. EOS Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. EOS He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. EOS He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely. EOS He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read. EOS He turned over the leaves. EOS It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. EOS Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of. EOS In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him. EOS Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling. EOS He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him. EOS 'What's that!' EOS he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door. EOS 'Who's there?' EOS Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. EOS It was Nancy. EOS 'Put down the light,' said the girl, turning away her head. EOS 'It hurts my eyes.' EOS Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. EOS 'God forgive me!' EOS she cried after a while, 'I never thought of this.' EOS asked Oliver. EOS 'Can I help you? EOS I will if I can. EOS 'Nancy!' EOS cried Oliver, 'What is it?' EOS Oliver stirred the fire. EOS Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round. EOS Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?' EOS 'Am I to go with you?' EOS 'Yes. EOS I have come from Bill,' replied the girl. EOS 'You are to go with me.' EOS 'What for?' EOS 'What for?' EOS echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy's face. EOS 'Oh! EOS For no harm.' EOS 'Have it your own way,' rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. EOS 'For no good, then.' EOS Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl's better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state. EOS As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward:  and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready. EOS Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion. EOS She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts. EOS 'You can't help yourself. EOS If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.' EOS Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise. EOS She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness. EOS I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. EOS See here! EOS She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity:  'Remember this! EOS And don't let me suffer more for you, just now. EOS They don't mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. EOS Hush! EOS Every word from you is a blow for me. EOS Give me your hand. EOS Make haste! EOS Your hand!' EOS The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out. EOS A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. EOS The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant. EOS The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. EOS While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut. EOS 'Bill!' EOS 'Hallo!' EOS replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle. EOS That's the time of day. EOS Come on!' EOS This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes' temperament. EOS 'Bull's-eye's gone home with Tom,' observed Sikes, as he lighted them up. EOS 'That's right,' rejoined Nancy. EOS 'So you've got the kid,' said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke. EOS 'Yes, here he is,' replied Nancy. EOS inquired Sikes. EOS 'I'm glad to hear it,' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; 'for the sake of his young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered for it. EOS Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver's cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him. EOS inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table. EOS Oliver replied in the affirmative. EOS Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation. EOS 'Yes, I see it is, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'Well,' said the robber, grasping Oliver's wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; 'if you speak a word when you're out o'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice. EOS So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.' EOS Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued. EOS 'That's it!' EOS observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; 'women can always put things in fewest words.--Except when it's blowing up; and then they lengthens it out. EOS Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. EOS Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time. EOS For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light. EOS Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep. EOS Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. EOS growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; 'half-past five! EOS Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready. EOS Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl. EOS CHAPTER XXI  THE EXPEDITION  It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. EOS There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene:  the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and dreary streets. EOS By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break. EOS Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time. EOS The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. EOS By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with. EOS It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun. EOS All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep. EOS Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses. EOS Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. EOS He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn. EOS 'Now, young 'un!' EOS you must step out. EOS Come, don't lag behind already, Lazy-legs!' EOS Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion's wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could. EOS They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington:  when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up. EOS Seeing 'Hounslow' written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth. EOS 'Jump up,' said the man. EOS 'Is that your boy?' EOS 'Your father walks rather too quick for you, don't he, my man?' EOS inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath. EOS 'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes, interposing. EOS 'He's used to it. EOS Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. EOS In with you!' EOS Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself. EOS As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him. EOS At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off. EOS And here, the cart stopped. EOS Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant manner. EOS 'Good-bye, boy,' said the man. EOS 'He's sulky,' replied Sikes, giving him a shake; 'he's sulky. EOS A young dog! EOS 'Not I!' EOS rejoined the other, getting into his cart. EOS 'It's a fine day, after all.' EOS They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen's houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. EOS They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours. EOS At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire. EOS The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking. EOS Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep. EOS Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale. EOS 'So, you're going on to Lower Halliford, are you?' EOS My horse hasn't got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin'; and he won't be long a-doing of it. EOS Ecod! EOS 'Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?' EOS demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend. EOS 'I'm your man, as far as I go,' replied the other. EOS 'Is all paid, Becky?' EOS 'Yes, the other gentleman's paid,' replied the girl. EOS said the man, with tipsy gravity; 'that won't do, you know.' EOS 'Why not?' EOS 'You're a-going to accommodate us, and wot's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?' EOS To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was. EOS The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside:  ready harnessed to the cart. EOS It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. EOS Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene. EOS As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. EOS There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite:  which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it. EOS There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind. EOS It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead. EOS Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road. EOS Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on. EOS On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge. EOS Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left. EOS 'The water!' EOS 'He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!' EOS He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed. EOS There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible. EOS The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited. EOS CHAPTER XXII  THE BURGLARY  'Hallo!' EOS cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage. EOS 'Show a glim, Toby.' EOS 'Aha! EOS my pal!' EOS cried the same voice. EOS 'A glim, Barney, a glim! EOS Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.' EOS 'Do you hear?' EOS cried the same voice. EOS 'Bister Sikes!' EOS exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; 'cub id, sir; cub id.' EOS 'Here! EOS you get on first,' said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him. EOS 'Quicker! EOS He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. EOS Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings. EOS He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction. EOS Hallo!' EOS Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was. EOS 'The boy. EOS Only the boy!' EOS 'Fagin's, eh!' EOS exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. EOS 'Wot an inwalable boy that'll make, for the old ladies' pockets in chapels! EOS His mug is a fortin' to him.' EOS 'There--there's enough of that,' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment. EOS 'Now,' said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, 'if you'll give us something to eat and drink while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events. EOS Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you'll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.' EOS Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him. EOS 'Here,' said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table,  'Success to the crack!' EOS He rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents. EOS Mr. Sikes did the same. EOS 'A drain for the boy,' said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. EOS echoed Toby. EOS Tell him to drink it, Bill.' EOS 'He had better!' EOS 'Burn my body, if he isn't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. EOS Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!' EOS Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor:  close outside the fender. EOS Oliver fell into a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day:  when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one. EOS In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation. EOS 'All right!' EOS 'The persuaders?' EOS 'Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies--nothing forgotten?' EOS inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat. EOS 'All right,' rejoined his companion. EOS With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney's hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver's cape. EOS said Sikes, holding out his hand. EOS Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose. EOS 'Take his other hand, Toby,' said Sikes. EOS The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. EOS The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. EOS It was now intensely dark. EOS The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver's hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about. EOS They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before. EOS Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. EOS A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night. EOS But there was nobody abroad. EOS They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two. EOS Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. EOS After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall:  to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling. EOS 'The boy next,' said Toby. EOS 'Hoist him up; I'll catch hold of him.' EOS Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side. EOS Sikes followed directly. EOS And they stole cautiously towards the house. EOS And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. EOS He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. EOS A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees. EOS 'Get up!' EOS murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; 'Get up, or I'll strew your brains upon the grass.' EOS 'Oh! EOS for God's sake let me go!' EOS I will never come near London; never, never! EOS Oh! EOS For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!' EOS The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy's mouth, and dragged him to the house. EOS cried the man; 'it won't answer here. EOS Say another word, and I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head. EOS That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. EOS I've seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.' EOS After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on its hinges. EOS It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house:  which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage. EOS The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver's size, nevertheless. EOS A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike's art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also. EOS Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.' EOS 'There's a bolt at the top, you won't be able to reach,' interposed Toby. EOS 'Stand upon one of the hall chairs. EOS replied Sikes, with a threatening look. EOS 'The room-door is open, is it?' EOS 'Wide,' replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. EOS 'The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who's got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. EOS Ha! EOS Barney 'ticed him away to-night. EOS Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work. EOS Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. EOS This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside. EOS 'Take this lantern,' said Sikes, looking into the room. EOS 'You see the stairs afore you?' EOS Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, 'Yes.' EOS 'It's done in a minute,' said Sikes, in the same low whisper. EOS 'Directly I leave go of you, do your work. EOS Hark!' EOS 'What's that?' EOS 'Now!' EOS Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily. EOS suddenly cried Sikes aloud. EOS 'Back! EOS back!' EOS Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. EOS He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up. EOS 'Clasp your arm tighter,' said Sikes, as he drew him through the window. EOS They've hit him. EOS Quick! EOS How the boy bleeds!' EOS Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace. EOS And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy's heart; and he saw or heard no more. EOS CHAPTER XXIII  WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS  The night was bitter cold. EOS The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad:  which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air. EOS Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. EOS Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world. EOS Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table:  on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy. EOS In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea. EOS As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,--so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled. EOS 'Well!' EOS said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; 'I'm sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for! EOS A great deal, if we did but know it. EOS Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea. EOS 'Drat the pot!' EOS said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; 'a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! EOS Oh dear!' EOS With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. EOS She had just tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door. EOS 'Oh, come in with you!' EOS said Mrs. Corney, sharply. EOS 'Some of the old women dying, I suppose. EOS They always die when I'm at meals. EOS Don't stand there, letting the cold air in, don't. EOS What's amiss now, eh?' EOS 'Nothing, ma'am, nothing,' replied a man's voice. EOS 'Dear me!' EOS exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, 'is that Mr. EOS Bumble?' EOS Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission. EOS 'Hard, indeed, ma'am,' replied the beadle. EOS 'Of course not. EOS When would they be, Mr. EOS Bumble?' EOS rejoined Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Why here's one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight. EOS Is he grateful? EOS Coals! EOS What would he do with coals? EOS Toast his cheese with 'em and then come back for more. EOS That's the way with these people, ma'am; give 'em a apron full of coals to-day, and they'll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.' EOS The day afore yesterday, a man--you have been a married woman, ma'am, and I may mention it to you--a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer's door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney. EOS As he wouldn't go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal. EOS "My heart!" EOS says the ungrateful villain, "what's the use of _this_ to me? EOS You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!" EOS "Then I'll die in the streets!" EOS 'Ha! EOS ha! EOS That was very good! EOS So like Mr. Grannett, wasn't it?' EOS 'Well, Mr. EOS Bumble?' EOS There's a obstinate pauper for you!' EOS 'It beats anything I could have believed,' observed the matron emphatically. EOS 'But don't you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble? EOS You're a gentleman of experience, and ought to know. EOS Come.' EOS The great principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don't want; and then they get tired of coming.' EOS 'Dear me!' EOS 'Well, that is a good one, too!' EOS 'Yes. EOS That's the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. EOS But, however,' said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, 'these are official secrets, ma'am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves. EOS Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go. EOS 'You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron. EOS Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. EOS As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. EOS Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. EOS As she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. EOS 'Sweet? EOS Mr. EOS Bumble?' EOS inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin. EOS Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department. EOS 'You have a cat, ma'am, I see,' said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; 'and kittens too, I declare!' EOS 'I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,' replied the matron. EOS 'They're _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.' EOS 'Very nice animals, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; 'so very domestic.' EOS 'Oh, yes!' EOS rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; 'so fond of their home too, that it's quite a pleasure, I'm sure.' EOS 'Mrs. EOS Corney, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon, 'I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma'am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma'am.' EOS 'Oh, Mr. EOS Bumble!' EOS 'It's of no use disguising facts, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive; 'I would drown it myself, with pleasure.' EOS 'Hard-hearted, ma'am?' EOS 'Hard?' EOS Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire. EOS It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble's part:  he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all. EOS Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped. EOS 'Hard-hearted, Mrs. EOS Corney?' EOS said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into the matron's face; 'are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs. EOS exclaimed the matron, 'what a very curious question from a single man. EOS What can you want to know for, Mr. EOS Bumble?' EOS 'Mr. EOS Bumble!' EOS Bumble, I shall scream!' EOS Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron's waist. EOS As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door:  which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence:  while the matron sharply demanded who was there. EOS It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity. EOS angrily demanded the matron. EOS 'I can't keep her alive, can I?' EOS 'No, no, mistress,' replied the old woman, 'nobody can; she's far beyond the reach of help. EOS I've seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death's a-coming, well enough. EOS At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn't even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular should occur. EOS Mr. Bumble's conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable. EOS CHAPTER XXIV  TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. EOS BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY  It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron's room. EOS How few of Nature's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! EOS The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven's surface clear. EOS It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin's side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth. EOS It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end. EOS There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary's apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill. EOS 'Cold night, Mrs. Corney,' said this young gentleman, as the matron entered. EOS 'Very cold, indeed, sir,' replied the mistress, in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke. EOS 'They're the board's choosing, sir,' returned the matron. EOS 'The least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm:  for our places are hard enough.' EOS The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman. EOS there, Mrs. EOS 'If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,' said the apothecary's apprentice, intent upon the toothpick's point. EOS 'It's a break-up of the system altogether. EOS The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed. EOS The apothecary's apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so:  when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe. EOS When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat. EOS The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice. EOS 'Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?' EOS inquired the messenger. EOS 'Not a word,' replied the other. EOS 'She plucked and tore at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. EOS She hasn't much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. EOS I ain't so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!' EOS 'Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?' EOS 'I tried to get it down,' rejoined the other. EOS 'But her teeth were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again. EOS So I drank it; and it did me good!' EOS Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily. EOS 'Ay, that she would,' rejoined the other; 'she had a merry heart. EOS 'A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork. EOS My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.' EOS Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own. EOS While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait? EOS 'Not long, mistress,' replied the second woman, looking up into her face. EOS Patience, patience! EOS 'Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!' EOS 'You, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?' EOS 'But will never be again,' added the second one; 'that is, she'll never wake again but once--and mind, mistress, that won't be for long!' EOS Mind that, you impudent old harridans. EOS The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them. EOS she cried, in a hollow voice. EOS said one of the women, stooping over her. EOS Nearer! EOS Let me whisper in your ear.' EOS She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners. EOS make haste!' EOS The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside. EOS 'Now listen to me,' said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy. EOS 'In this very room--in this very bed--I once nursed a pretty young creetur', that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood. EOS Let me think--what was the year again!' EOS 'Never mind the year,' said the impatient auditor; 'what about her?' EOS She wasn't cold--I tell you she wasn't cold, when I stole it!' EOS 'Stole what, for God's sake?' EOS '_It_!' EOS She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. EOS It was gold, I tell you! EOS Rich gold, that might have saved her life!' EOS 'Gold!' EOS echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back. EOS 'Go on, go on--yes--what of it? EOS 'She charged me to keep it safe,' replied the woman with a groan, 'and trusted me as the only woman about her. EOS I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child's death, perhaps, is on me besides! EOS They would have treated him better, if they had known it all!' EOS asked the other. EOS 'Speak!' EOS Poor girl! EOS She was so young, too! EOS I have not told you all, have I?' EOS 'Be quick, or it may be too late!' EOS 'The mother,' said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; 'the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named. EOS "And oh, kind Heaven!" EOS she said, folding her thin hands together, "whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!"' EOS 'The boy's name?' EOS demanded the matron. EOS 'They _called_ him Oliver,' replied the woman, feebly. EOS 'The gold I stole was--'  'Yes, yes--what?' EOS cried the other. EOS She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed. EOS *      *      *      *      *  'Stone dead!' EOS 'And nothing to tell, after all,' rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away. EOS The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body. EOS He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars. EOS The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling's hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour's cards. EOS He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company. EOS Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber. EOS Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be 'blowed,' or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. EOS 'That's two doubles and the rub,' said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. EOS Even when we've good cards, Charley and I can't make nothing of 'em.' EOS 'Matter, Fagin!' EOS 'I wish you had watched the play. EOS 'Ay, ay!' EOS ha! EOS my dear,' replied the Jew, 'you must get up very early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.' EOS 'Morning!' EOS said Charley Bates; 'you must put your boots on over-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your shoulders, if you want to come over him.' EOS Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness. EOS said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. EOS 'What do you think he's thinking of, Fagin?' EOS 'How should I know, my dear?' EOS replied the Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows. EOS 'About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he's just left, eh? EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS Is that it, my dear?' EOS 'Not a bit of it,' replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. EOS See how he's a-blushing! EOS Oh, my eye! EOS Oh, Fagin, Fagin! EOS 'Never mind him, my dear,' said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows. EOS Stick up to her, Tom. EOS 'What I mean to say, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, 'is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.' EOS 'No more it is,' replied the Jew; 'Charley will talk. EOS Don't mind him, my dear; don't mind him. EOS Betsy's a fine girl. EOS Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.' EOS 'So I _do_ do as she bids me,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I shouldn't have been milled, if it hadn't been for her advice. EOS And what's six weeks of it? EOS 'Ah, to be sure, my dear,' replied the Jew. EOS 'You wouldn't mind it again, Tom, would you,' asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, 'if Bet was all right?' EOS 'I mean to say that I shouldn't,' replied Tom, angrily. EOS Ah! EOS 'Nobody, my dear,' replied the Jew; 'not a soul, Tom. EOS I don't know one of 'em that would do it besides you; not one of 'em, my dear.' EOS 'I might have got clear off, if I'd split upon her; mightn't I, Fagin?' EOS angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. EOS 'But I didn't blab it; did I, Fagin?' EOS demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility. EOS 'No, no, to be sure,' replied the Jew; 'you were too stout-hearted for that. EOS A deal too stout, my dear!' EOS 'Perhaps I was,' rejoined Tom, looking round; 'and if I was, what's to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?' EOS The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. EOS But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay. EOS 'Hark!' EOS cried the Dodger at this moment, 'I heard the tinkler.' EOS The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness. EOS 'What!' EOS cried the Jew, 'alone?' EOS The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just then. EOS Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew's face, and awaited his directions. EOS The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to know the worst. EOS At length he raised his head. EOS 'Where is he?' EOS The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room. EOS 'Yes,' said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; 'bring him down. EOS Hush! EOS Gently, Tom! EOS This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed. EOS There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit. EOS 'How are you, Faguey?' EOS 'Pop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that's the time of day! EOS You'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.' EOS With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob. EOS 'See there, Faguey,' he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots; 'not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove! EOS But don't look at me in that way, man. EOS All in good time. EOS I can't talk about business till I've eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let's have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days!' EOS The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure. EOS He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore:  and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. EOS Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. EOS It was all of no use. EOS 'First and foremost, Faguey,' said Toby. EOS interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair. EOS Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed. EOS 'First and foremost, Faguey,' said the housebreaker, 'how's Bill?' EOS 'What!' EOS screamed the Jew, starting from his seat. EOS Sikes and the boy! EOS Where have they been? EOS Why have they not been here?' EOS 'The crack failed,' said Toby faintly. EOS 'I know it,' replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it. EOS 'What more?' EOS 'They fired and hit the boy. EOS We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us--straight as the crow flies--through hedge and ditch. EOS They gave chase. EOS the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.' EOS 'The boy!' EOS They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! EOS Alive or dead, that's all I know about him.' EOS The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house. EOS He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger:  drove him back upon the pavement. EOS Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill. EOS Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them. EOS Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse. EOS It is a commercial colony of itself:  the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come. EOS Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars. EOS It was into this place that the Jew turned. EOS He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. EOS He replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child's chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door. EOS 'Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!' EOS 'The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,' said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders. EOS 'Well, I've heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,' replied the trader; 'but it soon cools down again; don't you find it so?' EOS Fagin nodded in the affirmative. EOS Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night. EOS 'At the Cripples?' EOS inquired the man. EOS 'Yes, there's some half-dozen of 'em gone in, that I knows. EOS I don't think your friend's there.' EOS 'Sikes is not, I suppose?' EOS 'Have you got anything in my line to-night?' EOS 'Nothing to-night,' said the Jew, turning away. EOS 'Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?' EOS cried the little man, calling after him. EOS 'Stop! EOS But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively's presence. EOS By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour. EOS The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons:  was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured. EOS The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside. EOS The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more. EOS By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner. EOS When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman's right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause. EOS There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said--and sharp ones, too. EOS Near him were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness. EOS Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked:  others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture. EOS Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search. EOS 'What can I do for you, Mr. EOS 'Won't you join us? EOS The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, 'Is _he_ here?' EOS 'No,' replied the man. EOS 'And no news of Barney?' EOS inquired Fagin. EOS 'None,' replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. EOS 'He won't stir till it's all safe. EOS asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before. EOS 'Monks, do you mean?' EOS inquired the landlord, hesitating. EOS said the Jew. EOS 'Yes.' EOS 'Certain,' replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; 'I expected him here before now. EOS If you'll wait ten minutes, he'll be--'  'No, no,' said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his absence. EOS 'Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me to-night. EOS No, say to-morrow. EOS said the man. EOS 'Not a word now,' said the Jew, descending the stairs. EOS 'I say,' said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; 'what a time this would be for a sell! EOS I've got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!' EOS But it's not Phil Barker's time,' said the Jew, looking up. EOS 'Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives--_while they last_. EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS ha!' EOS The landlord reciprocated the old man's laugh; and returned to his guests. EOS The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought. EOS After a brief reflection, he called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. EOS 'Now,' muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, 'if there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.' EOS She was in her room, the woman said. EOS Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony. EOS The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it. EOS 'She has been drinking,' thought the Jew, cooly, 'or perhaps she is only miserable.' EOS The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl. EOS When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word. EOS She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all. EOS Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. EOS At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone,  'And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?' EOS The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying. EOS 'And the boy, too,' said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face. EOS 'Poor leetle child! EOS 'What!' EOS cried the Jew, in amazement. EOS 'Ay, I do,' returned the girl, meeting his gaze. EOS The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.' EOS said the Jew, scornfully. EOS 'Am I?' EOS cried the girl bitterly. EOS You'd never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;--the humour doesn't suit you, doesn't it?' EOS 'Change it, then!' EOS responded the girl, with a laugh. EOS Listen to me, you drab. EOS If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. EOS And do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!' EOS 'What is all this?' EOS cried the girl involuntarily. EOS 'What is it?' EOS pursued Fagin, mad with rage. EOS 'When the boy's worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of! EOS After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. EOS 'Nancy, dear!' EOS croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. EOS 'Did you mind me, dear?' EOS replied the girl, raising her head languidly. EOS 'If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. EOS He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can't he won't; so no more about that.' EOS 'Regarding this boy, my dear?' EOS said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together. EOS 'The boy must take his chance with the rest,' interrupted Nancy, hastily; 'and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm's way, and out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm. EOS 'And about what I was saying, my dear?' EOS observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her. EOS 'You must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do,' rejoined Nancy; 'and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. EOS Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of 'Never say die!' EOS It was within an hour of midnight. EOS The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter. EOS It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way. EOS He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived. EOS whispered a voice close to his ear. EOS said the Jew, turning quickly round, 'is that--'  'Yes!' EOS Where the devil have you been?' EOS 'On your business, my dear,' replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. EOS 'On your business all night.' EOS 'Oh, of course!' EOS said the stranger, with a sneer. EOS 'Nothing bad, I hope?' EOS said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his companion. EOS 'Shut the door,' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. EOS As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise. EOS 'That wasn't my doing,' said the other man, feeling his way. EOS 'The wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. EOS Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.' EOS Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. EOS After a short absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one. EOS There!' EOS This done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door. EOS It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall. EOS They conversed for some time in whispers. EOS Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation. EOS They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks--by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy--said, raising his voice a little,  'I tell you again, it was badly planned. EOS Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?' EOS 'Only hear him!' EOS exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders. EOS 'Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?' EOS demanded Monks, sternly. EOS 'Haven't you done it, with other boys, scores of times? EOS 'Mine,' replied Monks. EOS 'But not mine,' said the Jew, submissively. EOS 'He might have become of use to me. EOS When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?' EOS 'What then?' EOS demanded Monks. EOS 'I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,' replied the Jew; 'he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.' EOS muttered the man, 'or he would have been a thief, long ago.' EOS 'I had no hold upon him to make him worse,' pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his companion. EOS I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain. EOS What could I do? EOS Send him out with the Dodger and Charley? EOS We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.' EOS 'And I don't quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for. EOS Well! EOS 'Throttle the girl!' EOS said Monks, impatiently. EOS 'Why, we can't afford to do that just now, my dear,' replied the Jew, smiling; 'and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done. EOS As soon as the boy begins to harden, she'll care no more for him, than for a block of wood. EOS You want him made a thief. EOS interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew's arm with trembling hands. EOS 'Mind that. EOS Fagin! EOS I had no hand in it. EOS I won't shed blood; it's always found out, and haunts a man besides. EOS Fire this infernal den! EOS What's that?' EOS 'The shadow! EOS The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. EOS The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed. EOS It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. EOS replied Monks, trembling. EOS The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. EOS They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. EOS They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. EOS The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death. EOS 'What do you think now?' EOS As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference. EOS This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. EOS He declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night:  suddenly remembering that it was past one o'clock. EOS And so the amiable couple parted. EOS CHAPTER XXVII  ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY  As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words--trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated--hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. EOS Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong:  which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted:  that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church:  is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies' beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim. EOS Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. EOS Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest of drawers. EOS Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. EOS He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath. EOS 'Mrs. EOS Corney,' said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, 'what is this, ma'am? EOS Pray answer me: I'm on--on--' Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word 'tenterhooks,' so he said 'broken bottles.' EOS 'Oh, Mr. EOS cried the lady, 'I have been so dreadfully put out!' EOS 'Put out, ma'am!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Bumble; 'who has dared to--? EOS I know!' EOS said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, 'this is them wicious paupers!' EOS 'I can't help it,' whimpered the lady. EOS 'A little of the wine?' EOS replied Mrs. Corney. EOS The top shelf in the right-hand corner--oh!' EOS Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms. EOS Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips. EOS 'I'm better now,' said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it. EOS 'Peppermint,' exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke. EOS There's a little--a little something else in it.' EOS Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty. EOS 'It's very comforting,' said Mrs. Corney. EOS As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her. EOS 'Nothing,' replied Mrs. Corney. EOS 'I am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.' EOS 'Not weak, ma'am,' retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer. EOS 'Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. EOS 'We are all weak creeturs,' said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general principle. EOS 'So we are,' said the beadle. EOS Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. EOS Mrs. Corney sighed. EOS 'Don't sigh, Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'I can't help it,' said Mrs. Corney. EOS And she sighed again. EOS 'But not for two, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. EOS 'Eh, Mrs. EOS Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble. EOS inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand. EOS 'And candles,' replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure. EOS 'Coals, candles, and house-rent free,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Oh, Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!' EOS She sank into Mr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose. EOS exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. EOS 'The little word?' EOS said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty. EOS 'The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?' EOS sighed out the matron. EOS When is it to come off?' EOS Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak:  and twice failed. EOS At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble's neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was 'a irresistible duck.' EOS 'Very good,' said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; 'I'll call at Sowerberry's as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. EOS Was it that as frightened you, love?' EOS 'It wasn't anything particular, dear,' said the lady evasively. EOS 'It must have been something, love,' urged Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Won't you tell your own B.?' EOS After we're married, dear.' EOS 'After we're married!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Bumble. EOS 'It wasn't any impudence from any of them male paupers as--'  'No, no, love!' EOS interposed the lady, hastily. EOS 'They had better not!' EOS said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. EOS 'Let me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn't do it a second time!' EOS Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove. EOS The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers' ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity. EOS Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion:  which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker. EOS At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. EOS Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. EOS A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman's nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted. EOS 'Here's a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!' EOS said Charlotte; 'try him, do; only this one.' EOS remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it. EOS 'It's quite a cruelty,' said Charlotte. EOS 'An't yer fond of oysters?' EOS 'Not overmuch,' replied Charlotte. EOS 'I like to see you eat 'em, Noah dear, better than eating 'em myself.' EOS 'Lor!' EOS 'Here's one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!' EOS 'I can't manage any more,' said Noah. EOS 'I'm very sorry. EOS 'What!' EOS 'Say that again, sir.' EOS Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. EOS 'Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!' EOS said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'How dare you mention such a thing, sir? EOS And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx? EOS Kiss her!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation. EOS 'Faugh!' EOS 'I didn't mean to do it!' EOS said Noah, blubbering. EOS 'She's always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.' EOS 'Oh, Noah,' cried Charlotte, reproachfully. EOS 'Yer are; yer know yer are!' EOS retorted Noah. EOS 'She's always a-doin' of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!' EOS 'Silence!' EOS 'Take yourself downstairs, ma'am. EOS Do you hear sir? EOS Kissing!' EOS 'The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful! EOS If Parliament don't take their abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!' EOS With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker's premises. EOS And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman's funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him. EOS CHAPTER XXVIII  LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES  'Wolves tear your throats!' EOS muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. EOS 'Stop, you white-livered hound!' EOS cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead. EOS For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with. EOS cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket. EOS 'Don't play booty with me.' EOS At this moment the noise grew louder. EOS Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them. EOS Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone. EOS 'Pincher! EOS Come here, come here!' EOS The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command. EOS Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together. EOS 'I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,' said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are. EOS 'I shouldn't wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,' said the third, who had called the dogs back, 'Mr. EOS Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.' EOS To tell the truth, the little man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke. EOS 'You are afraid, Brittles,' said Mr. Giles. EOS 'You're a falsehood, Mr. Giles,' said Brittles. EOS Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles's taunt; and Mr. Giles's taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. EOS The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically. EOS 'I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen,' said he, 'we're all afraid.' EOS 'Speak for yourself, sir,' said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the party. EOS 'So I do,' replied the man. EOS 'It's natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances. EOS I am.' EOS 'So am I,' said Brittles; 'only there's no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.' EOS These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he_ was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech. EOS 'But it's wonderful,' said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, 'what a man will do, when his blood is up. EOS I should have committed murder--I know I should--if we'd caught one of them rascals.' EOS As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament. EOS 'I know what it was,' said Mr. Giles; 'it was the gate.' EOS 'I shouldn't wonder if it was,' exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea. EOS I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.' EOS It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance. EOS Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty. EOS Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire. EOS Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne. EOS The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke. EOS The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. EOS Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him. EOS Morning drew on apace. EOS The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes. EOS But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay. EOS His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood. EOS He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain. EOS After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver:  urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die:  got upon his feet, and essayed to walk. EOS His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man. EOS Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber's grasp upon his wrist. EOS Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. EOS Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road. EOS Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him. EOS He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach. EOS Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. EOS He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it. EOS As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before. EOS That garden wall! EOS On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men's mercy. EOS It was the very house they had attempted to rob. EOS Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight. EOS He could scarcely stand:  and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly? EOS He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. EOS It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. EOS Not that it was Mr. Giles's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society. EOS At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear.  ' EOS --Heerd a noise,' continued Mr. Giles. EOS 'I says, at first, "This is illusion"; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.' EOS 'What sort of a noise?' EOS asked the cook. EOS 'A kind of a busting noise,' replied Mr. Giles, looking round him. EOS I turned down the clothes'; continued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, 'sat up in bed; and listened.' EOS and drew their chairs closer together. EOS 'I heerd it now, quite apparent,' resumed Mr. Giles. EOS '"Somebody," I says, "is forcing of a door, or window; what's to be done? EOS Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror. EOS 'I tossed off the clothes,' said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, 'got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of--'  'Ladies present, Mr. Giles,' murmured the tinker.  ' EOS --Of _shoes_, sir,' said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; 'seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room. EOS 'So you did,' observed Brittles, in a low voice. EOS '"We're dead men, I think, Brittles," I says,' continued Giles; '"but don't be frightened."' EOS '_Was_ he frightened?' EOS asked the cook. EOS 'Not a bit of it,' replied Mr. Giles. EOS 'He was as firm--ah! EOS pretty near as firm as I was.' EOS 'You're a woman,' retorted Brittles, plucking up a little. EOS We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle's hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,--as it might be so.' EOS Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair. EOS The cook and housemaid screamed. EOS 'It was a knock,' said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. EOS 'Open the door, somebody.' EOS Nobody moved. EOS 'It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,' said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; 'but the door must be opened. EOS Do you hear, somebody?' EOS Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply. EOS Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep. EOS 'If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,' said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, 'I am ready to make one.' EOS 'So am I,' said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep. EOS Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. EOS The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. EOS By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs' tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely. EOS 'A boy!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background. EOS 'What's the matter with the--eh?--Why--Brittles--look here--don't you know?' EOS Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry. EOS Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof. EOS 'Here he is!' EOS Here's a thief, miss! EOS I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.' EOS '--In a lantern, miss,' cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better. EOS The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged. EOS In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant. EOS 'I'm here, miss,' replied Mr. Giles. EOS 'Don't be frightened, miss; I ain't much injured. EOS He didn't make a very desperate resistance, miss! EOS I was soon too many for him.' EOS 'Hush!' EOS replied the young lady; 'you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. EOS Is the poor creature much hurt?' EOS 'Wounded desperate, miss,' replied Giles, with indescribable complacency. EOS 'He looks as if he was a-going, miss,' bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before. EOS 'Wouldn't you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?' EOS 'Hush, pray; there's a good man!' EOS rejoined the lady. EOS 'Wait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.' EOS With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away. EOS asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down. EOS 'Not now, for the world,' replied the young lady. EOS Oh! EOS Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman. EOS CHAPTER XXIX  HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED  In a handsome room:  though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance:  there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. EOS Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. EOS Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her. EOS Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion. EOS She was not past seventeen. EOS Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. EOS The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness. EOS She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. EOS Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her. EOS 'And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?' EOS asked the old lady, after a pause. EOS 'An hour and twelve minutes, ma'am,' replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon. EOS 'Brittles always was a slow boy, ma'am,' replied the attendant. EOS And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one. EOS 'He gets worse instead of better, I think,' said the elder lady. EOS Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together. EOS 'I never heard of such a thing!' EOS exclaimed the fat gentleman. EOS 'My dear Mrs. Maylie--bless my soul--in the silence of the night, too--I _never_ heard of such a thing!' EOS 'You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,' said the fat gentleman. EOS 'Why didn't you send? EOS Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I'm sure, under such circumstances. EOS So unexpected! EOS In the silence of the night, too!' EOS 'And you, Miss Rose,' said the doctor, turning to the young lady, 'I--'  'Oh! EOS very much so, indeed,' said Rose, interrupting him; 'but there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.' EOS 'Ah! EOS That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.' EOS 'Honour, eh?' EOS said the doctor; 'well, I don't know; perhaps it's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces. EOS Fancy that he fired in the air, and you've fought a duel, Giles.' EOS Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party. EOS 'Gad, that's true!' EOS 'Where is he? EOS Show me the way. EOS I'll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. EOS That's the little window that he got in at, eh? EOS Well, I couldn't have believed it!' EOS Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as 'the doctor,' had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive. EOS The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated. EOS At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully. EOS 'This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,' said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut. EOS said the old lady. EOS Have you seen the thief?' EOS 'No,' rejoined the old lady. EOS 'No.' EOS 'I beg your pardon, ma'am, interposed Mr. Giles; 'but I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.' EOS The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. EOS rejoined the doctor. EOS 'There is nothing very alarming in his appearance. EOS 'Then I think it is necessary,' said the doctor; 'at all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it. EOS He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. EOS CHAPTER XXX  RELATES WHAT OLIVER'S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM  With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady's arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs. EOS 'Now,' said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door, 'let us hear what you think of him. EOS Stepping before them, he looked into the room. EOS Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:  worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. EOS The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. EOS As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead. EOS Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall. EOS 'What can this mean?' EOS exclaimed the elder lady. EOS 'This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!' EOS urged Rose. EOS 'My dear young lady,' rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; 'crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone. EOS The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.' EOS 'But, can you--oh! EOS said Rose. EOS The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment. EOS as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!' EOS 'My dear love,' said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, 'do you think I would harm a hair of his head?' EOS replied Rose, eagerly. EOS What can I do to save him, sir?' EOS 'Let me think, ma'am,' said the doctor; 'let me think.' EOS Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. EOS After various exclamations of 'I've got it now' and 'no, I haven't,' and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:  'I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. EOS You don't object to that?' EOS 'Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,' replied Mrs. Maylie. EOS 'There is no other,' said the doctor. EOS 'No other, take my word for it.' EOS 'You seem to think,' retorted the doctor, 'that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. EOS I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.' EOS 'You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,' returned Rose, blushing. EOS The great point of our agreement is yet to come. EOS He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn't be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger. EOS 'Oh no, aunt!' EOS entreated Rose. EOS 'Oh yes, aunt!' EOS 'Is is a bargain?' EOS 'Very good,' retorted the doctor; 'then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.' EOS Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake. EOS It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. EOS The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done. EOS The conference was a long one. EOS Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. EOS It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him. EOS Oh! EOS Oliver's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept. EOS He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur. EOS And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went. EOS The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale--as indeed he had. EOS 'Sit still!' EOS said the doctor, waving his hand. EOS 'Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles. EOS Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles's condescension. EOS Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them. EOS asked Giles. EOS 'So-so'; returned the doctor. EOS 'I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. EOS Giles.' EOS 'I hope you don't mean to say, sir,' said Mr. Giles, trembling, 'that he's going to die. EOS If I thought it, I should never be happy again. EOS I wouldn't cut a boy off:  no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.' EOS Giles, are you a Protestant?' EOS 'Yes, sir, I hope so,' faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale. EOS 'And what are _you_, boy?' EOS said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles. EOS replied Brittles, starting violently; 'I'm the same as Mr. Giles, sir.' EOS We are prepared for you!' EOS said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's utmost acuteness. EOS 'Something may come of this before long.' EOS The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner. EOS 'That's what it is, sir,' replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way. EOS 'Here's the house broken into,' said the doctor, 'and a couple of men catch one moment's glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. EOS Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?' EOS He said, if that wasn't law, he would be glad to know what was. EOS 'I ask you again,' thundered the doctor, 'are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?' EOS Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels. EOS 'It's the runners!' EOS 'The what?' EOS 'The Bow Street officers, sir,' replied Brittles, taking up a candle; 'me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.' EOS 'What?' EOS cried the doctor. EOS 'Yes,' replied Brittles; 'I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren't here before, sir.' EOS 'You did, did you? EOS 'Open the door,' replied a man outside; 'it's the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to to-day.' EOS Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there. EOS 'Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?' EOS said the officer; 'he's in the gig, a-minding the prad. EOS Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig:  while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration. EOS The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. EOS The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose. EOS 'Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?' EOS 'Oh! EOS Good-evening, master. EOS Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?' EOS 'This is the lady of the house,' said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie. EOS Mr. Blathers made a bow. EOS Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. EOS The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it--one of the two--seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment. EOS 'Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,' said Blathers. EOS 'What are the circumstances?' EOS Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution. EOS Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod. EOS said Mr. Losberne, with a smile. EOS 'This is all about the robbery, is it?' EOS 'All,' replied the doctor. EOS said Blathers. EOS 'Nothing at all,' replied the doctor. EOS 'One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity.' EOS 'Wery easy disposed of, if it is,' remarked Duff. EOS What account does he give of himself? EOS Where did he come from? EOS He didn't drop out of the clouds, did he, master?' EOS 'Of course not,' replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies. EOS 'I know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently. EOS You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?' EOS 'Certainly,' rejoined Mr. Blathers. EOS That's the usual way of doing business.' EOS This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child's play. EOS Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces. EOS 'Upon my word,' he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, 'I hardly know what to do.' EOS 'Surely,' said Rose, 'the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.' EOS 'I doubt it, my dear young lady,' said the doctor, shaking his head. EOS 'I don't think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade. EOS What is he, after all, they would say? EOS A runaway. EOS Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.' EOS 'You believe it, surely?' EOS '_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,' rejoined the doctor; 'but I don't think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.' EOS 'Why not?' EOS 'Because, my pretty cross-examiner,' replied the doctor: 'because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. EOS On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman's pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman's house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea. EOS He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! EOS As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! EOS 'I see it, of course,' replied Rose, smiling at the doctor's impetuosity; 'but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.' EOS They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.' EOS Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before. EOS 'The more I think of it,' said the doctor, 'the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy's real story. EOS 'Oh! EOS cried Rose. EOS 'Dear, dear! EOS 'I would not have had them here, for the world.' EOS 'All I know is,' said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, 'that we must try and carry it off with a bold face. EOS The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that's one comfort. EOS 'Well, master,' said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. EOS 'This warn't a put-up thing.' EOS demanded the doctor, impatiently. EOS 'Nobody suspected them, in this case,' said Mrs. Maylie. EOS 'Wery likely not, ma'am,' replied Blathers; 'but they might have been in it, for all that.' EOS 'Wery pretty indeed it is,' remarked Duff, in an undertone. EOS That's all to be said at present. EOS 'Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. EOS Maylie?' EOS to be sure!' EOS exclaimed Rose, eagerly. EOS said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; 'it's dry work, this sort of duty. EOS 'What shall it be?' EOS asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard. EOS 'A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same,' replied Blathers. EOS This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously. EOS 'That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,' said Mr. Duff, assisting his colleague's memory. EOS 'That was something in this way, warn't it?' EOS rejoined Mr. Blathers; 'that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.' EOS 'You always gave that to him' replied Duff. EOS Conkey hadn't any more to do with it than I had.' EOS retorted Mr. Blathers; 'I know better. EOS What a start that was! EOS Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!' EOS 'What was that?' EOS inquired Rose:  anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors. EOS 'It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,' said Blathers. EOS 'Of course the lady knows that, don't she?' EOS demanded Mr. Blathers. EOS 'Always interrupting, you are, partner! EOS This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I've seen 'em off'en. EOS He was wery quick about it. EOS But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. EOS However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don't know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. EOS One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house. EOS "I see him, Spyers," said Chickweed, "pass my house yesterday morning," "Why didn't you up, and collar him!" EOS says Spyers. EOS Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice. EOS He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, "Here he is! EOS Murder!" EOS and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad. EOS "D--me!" EOS says Chickweed, "I've lost him again!" EOS Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again. EOS At last, he couldn't help shutting 'em, to ease 'em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, "Here he is!" EOS Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday's one, the man's lost again! EOS This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.' EOS But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says "Chickweed, I've found out who done this here robbery." EOS "Have you?" EOS "Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! EOS Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!" EOS "Come!" EOS said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, "none of that gammon! EOS You did it yourself." EOS So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn't been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!' EOS 'Now, if you please, you can walk upstairs.' EOS 'If _you_ please, sir,' returned Mr. Blathers. EOS Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle. EOS Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet. EOS Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward--in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing. EOS 'This,' said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, 'this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d' ye-call-him's grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand:  who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.' EOS Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice. EOS The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity. EOS 'You don't mean to deny that, I suppose?' EOS said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again. EOS 'It was all done for the--for the best, sir,' answered Giles. EOS 'I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn't have meddled with him. EOS I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.' EOS 'Thought it was what boy?' EOS inquired the senior officer. EOS 'The housebreaker's boy, sir!' EOS replied Giles. EOS 'Well? EOS Do you think so now?' EOS inquired Blathers. EOS rejoined Blathers, impatiently. EOS 'I don't know; I really don't know,' said Giles, with a rueful countenance. EOS 'What do you think?' EOS asked Mr. Blathers. EOS 'I don't know what to think,' replied poor Giles. EOS 'What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!' EOS said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt. EOS Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. EOS Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning. EOS With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly. EOS The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King's subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went. EOS In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver's appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed. EOS Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. EOS CHAPTER XXXII  OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS  Oliver's ailings were neither slight nor few. EOS In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague:  which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly. EOS 'Poor fellow!' EOS We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. EOS The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. EOS We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.' EOS dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!' EOS 'You shall give nothing at all,' said Miss Maylie, smiling; 'for, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.' EOS 'Happy, ma'am!' EOS cried Oliver; 'how kind of you to say so!' EOS 'To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine. EOS Do you understand me?' EOS 'Oh yes, ma'am, yes!' EOS replied Oliver eagerly; 'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.' EOS 'To whom?' EOS inquired the young lady. EOS 'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,' rejoined Oliver. EOS 'I am sure they would,' rejoined Oliver's benefactress; 'and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.' EOS 'Has he, ma'am?' EOS 'I don't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!' EOS One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. EOS 'Do you see anything--hear anything--feel anything--eh?' EOS 'That, sir,' cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. EOS 'Yes; well, what of it? EOS Stop coachman. EOS 'What of the house, my man; eh?' EOS 'The thieves--the house they took me to!' EOS whispered Oliver. EOS 'The devil it is!' EOS 'Hallo, there! EOS let me out!' EOS But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman. EOS said a little ugly hump-backed man:  opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage. EOS 'Matter!' EOS exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment's reflection. EOS The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor's grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house. EOS Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley. EOS He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver's description! EOS 'Now!' EOS said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, 'what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? EOS Which is it?' EOS 'Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?' EOS said the irritable doctor. EOS 'Will you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? EOS Curse you!' EOS 'As soon as I think proper,' said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver's account of it. EOS 'I shall find you out, some day, my friend.' EOS 'Will you?' EOS sneered the ill-favoured cripple. EOS 'If you ever want me, I'm here. EOS I haven't lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you. EOS And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage. EOS 'Stupid enough, this,' muttered the doctor to himself; 'the boy must have made a mistake. EOS Here! EOS Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.' EOS He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage. EOS said the doctor, after a long silence. EOS 'Did you know that before, Oliver?' EOS 'No, sir.' EOS 'An ass,' said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes. EOS That would have served me right, though. EOS I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse. EOS It might have done me good.' EOS Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him. EOS If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver's story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any. EOS When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath. EOS 'That! EOS replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. EOS 'The white house. EOS make haste! EOS Pray make haste! EOS 'Come, come!' EOS 'You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.' EOS 'Oh! EOS I hope so!' EOS cried Oliver. EOS The coach rolled on. EOS No; that was the wrong house; the next door. EOS Alas! EOS the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. EOS 'To Let.' EOS 'Knock at the next door,' cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in his. EOS 'What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?' EOS She presently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before. EOS Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward. EOS 'Has his housekeeper gone too?' EOS 'Yes, sir'; replied the servant. EOS 'Then turn towards home again,' said Mr. Losberne to the driver; 'and don't stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!' EOS 'The book-stall keeper, sir?' EOS 'My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,' said the doctor. EOS 'Quite enough for both of us. EOS If we go to the book-stall keeper's, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away. EOS This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. EOS The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors. EOS After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months. EOS Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village! EOS Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature's face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being. EOS Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! EOS The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. EOS Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain. EOS The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts. EOS Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write:  and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him. EOS And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! EOS and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time! EOS There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:  the birds singing without:  and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. EOS The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before. EOS Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself. EOS In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table. EOS There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie's birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste. EOS When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done. EOS CHAPTER XXXIII  WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK  Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. EOS If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness. EOS The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond. EOS The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. EOS It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing. EOS Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. EOS He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him. EOS Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds. EOS Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. EOS The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual. EOS After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping. EOS 'Rose, my dear!' EOS said the elder lady. EOS Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts. EOS 'Rose, my love!' EOS cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her. EOS 'What is this? EOS In tears! EOS My dear child, what distresses you?' EOS 'Nothing, aunt; nothing,' replied the young lady. EOS interposed Mrs. Maylie. EOS Oh, not ill!' EOS replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; 'I shall be better presently. EOS Close the window, pray!' EOS Oliver hastened to comply with her request. EOS Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress. EOS said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, 'I never saw you so before.' EOS 'I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,' rejoined Rose; 'but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. EOS Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:  and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye. EOS She don't look well to-night, but--'  The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. EOS At length, she said, in a trembling voice:  'I hope not, Oliver. EOS 'What?' EOS inquired Oliver. EOS 'The heavy blow,' said the old lady, 'of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.' EOS 'Oh! EOS exclaimed Oliver, hastily. EOS 'Amen to that, my child!' EOS said the old lady, wringing her hands. EOS 'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?' EOS 'She is very ill now,' rejoined Mrs. Maylies; 'and will be worse, I am sure. EOS My dear, dear Rose! EOS She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm. EOS 'And consider, ma'am,' said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. EOS consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her. EOS I am sure--certain--quite certain--that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die. EOS 'Hush!' EOS But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. EOS I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love. EOS God's will be done! EOS I love her; and He knows how well!' EOS Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm. EOS He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully. EOS But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances. EOS How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves? EOS An anxious night ensued. EOS When morning came, Mrs. Maylie's predictions were but too well verified. EOS Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever. EOS It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field:  and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. EOS The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.' EOS I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.' EOS inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter. EOS 'No,' replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. EOS Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord's house in the country; where, he could not make out. EOS 'Shall it go, ma'am?' EOS asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently. EOS 'I think not,' replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. EOS 'I will wait until to-morrow.' EOS Here he paused, and looked about for the inn. EOS There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:  before which was the sign of 'The George.' EOS To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye. EOS This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill:  which took a long time making out:  and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more. EOS Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage. EOS He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door. EOS 'Hah!' EOS 'What the devil's this?' EOS 'I am sorry,' stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild look. EOS 'I hope I have not hurt you!' EOS 'Rot you!' EOS murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth; 'if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night. EOS Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp! EOS What are you doing here?' EOS Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. EOS Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time:  and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted. EOS The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory. EOS 'In fact,' he said, 'it would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.' EOS Oh! EOS All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside. EOS Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. EOS 'It is hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; 'so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.' EOS Another morning. EOS Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence. EOS He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds. EOS A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts. EOS Another! EOS Again! EOS They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother--a mother once--among the weeping train. EOS But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on. EOS Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. EOS There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time. EOS When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour. EOS They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. EOS The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure. EOS Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep. EOS They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered. EOS 'What of Rose?' EOS cried the old lady. EOS 'Tell me at once! EOS Oh, tell me! EOS in the name of Heaven!' EOS 'Be calm, my dear ma'am, pray.' EOS 'Let me go, in God's name! EOS She is dead! EOS cried the doctor, passionately. EOS 'As He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.' EOS He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast. EOS The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward:  laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber. EOS As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. EOS Looking round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him. EOS As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person. EOS In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses. EOS Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name. EOS 'Here!' EOS cried the voice. EOS Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news. EOS 'In a word!' EOS cried the gentleman, 'Better or worse?' EOS 'Better--much better!' EOS replied Oliver, hastily. EOS 'Thank Heaven!' EOS exclaimed the gentleman. EOS 'Quite, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside. EOS 'You are quite certain? EOS There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?' EOS 'Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.' EOS 'I would not for the world, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'Indeed you may believe me. EOS Mr. Losberne's words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come. EOS I heard him say so.' EOS The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes. EOS Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark--for he could well guess what his feelings were--and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay. EOS All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots. EOS That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him. EOS 'I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, Giles,' said he. EOS 'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her. EOS You can say I am coming.' EOS 'Well,' rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, 'you can do as you like. EOS Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. EOS Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.' EOS This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure. EOS He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing. EOS Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother. EOS Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage. EOS 'Mother!' EOS 'I did,' replied Mrs. Maylie; 'but, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne's opinion.' EOS 'But why,' said the young man, 'why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? EOS How could I ever have know happiness again!' EOS 'If that _had_ been the case, Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.' EOS rejoined the young man; 'or why should I say, _if_?--It is--it is--you know it, mother--you must know it!' EOS 'I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,' said Mrs. Maylie; 'I know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting. EOS 'This is unkind, mother,' said Harry. EOS 'Mother,' said the young man, impatiently, 'he would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.' EOS 'You think so now, Harry,' replied his mother. EOS 'The mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed. EOS On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! EOS my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman. EOS Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.' EOS 'Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'it is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. EOS But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.' EOS 'You will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?' EOS was the impatient reply; 'Mother, I have considered, years and years. EOS I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection. EOS My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? EOS Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.' EOS 'She shall,' said Mrs. Maylie. EOS 'There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,' said the young man. EOS 'Not coldly,' rejoined the old lady; 'far from it.' EOS 'How then?' EOS 'No, indeed,' replied his mother; 'you have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already. EOS What I would say,' resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, 'is this. EOS Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision:  devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.' EOS 'That I leave you to discover,' replied Mrs. Maylie. EOS God bless you!' EOS 'I shall see you again to-night?' EOS 'By and by,' replied the lady; 'when I leave Rose.' EOS 'You will tell her I am here?' EOS 'Of course,' replied Mrs. Maylie. EOS Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding. EOS The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them. EOS inquired the doctor, when he had concluded. EOS 'Nothing particular, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes. EOS 'Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?' EOS said the doctor. EOS 'Well,' said the doctor, 'I am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably. EOS Pray, how is Brittles?' EOS 'That's well,' said the doctor. EOS Just step into this corner a moment, will you?' EOS Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness. EOS The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit. EOS At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, 'No, no'; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so. EOS And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are. EOS So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need. EOS Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days. EOS The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. EOS The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. EOS Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. EOS The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision. EOS It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. EOS If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed. EOS Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering. EOS Nor did Oliver's time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. EOS He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself. EOS It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence. EOS It was quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume. EOS One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books. EOS There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. EOS So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two. EOS Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. EOS Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside. EOS And yet he was asleep. EOS Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew's house again. EOS There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him. EOS 'Hush, my dear!' EOS he thought he heard the Jew say; 'it is he, sure enough. EOS the other man seemed to answer; 'could I mistake him, think you? EOS If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out. EOS If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn't a mark above it, that he lay buried there?' EOS The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up. EOS what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! EOS And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard. EOS It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone. EOS But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. EOS He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help. EOS CHAPTER XXXV  CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE  When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, 'The Jew! EOS Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver's history from his mother, understood it at once. EOS 'What direction did he take?' EOS he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner. EOS 'Then, they are in the ditch!' EOS said Harry. EOS 'Follow! EOS Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter. EOS On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit. EOS The search was all in vain. EOS They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles. EOS A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason. EOS I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.' EOS 'Who was the other?' EOS inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together. EOS 'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,' said Oliver. EOS demanded Harry:  'are you sure?' EOS 'The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.' EOS The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said. EOS The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before. EOS 'This is strange!' EOS said Harry. EOS 'Strange?' EOS Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers. EOS Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery. EOS On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success. EOS After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself. EOS Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. EOS She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all. EOS But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark. EOS Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face. EOS After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides. EOS At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments. EOS 'What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.' EOS Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness. EOS 'I--I--ought to have left here, before,' said Harry. EOS 'I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,' said the young man; 'the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. EOS You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven. EOS There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature. EOS 'A creature,' continued the young man, passionately, 'a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God's own angels, fluttered between life and death. EOS Oh! EOS who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! EOS They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course. EOS Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.' EOS 'There is no pursuit more worthy of me:  more worthy of the highest nature that exists:  than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,' said the young man, taking her hand. EOS For years--for years--I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy's attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us! EOS That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.' EOS said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated. EOS 'As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.' EOS 'It is,' replied Rose, 'that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love. EOS Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. EOS Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.' EOS There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears. EOS Harry still retained the other. EOS 'And your reasons, Rose,' he said, at length, in a low voice; 'your reasons for this decision?' EOS 'You have a right to know them,' rejoined Rose. EOS It is a duty that I must perform. EOS 'To yourself?' EOS I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.' EOS 'They do not,' replied Rose, colouring deeply. EOS 'Then you return my love?' EOS 'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,' rejoined Rose, 'I could have--'  'Have received this declaration very differently?' EOS 'Do not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.' EOS she added, disengaging her hand, 'why should we prolong this painful interview? EOS Farewell, Harry! EOS As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!' EOS 'Another word, Rose,' said Harry. EOS All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you. EOS In a word,' said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, 'there is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. EOS I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.' EOS Dearest Rose! EOS one more!' EOS cried Harry, throwing himself before her. EOS 'If I had been less--less fortunate, the world would call it--if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny--if I had been poor, sick, helpless--would you have turned from me then? EOS 'The question does not arise, and never will. EOS It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.' EOS 'If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,' retorted Harry, 'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me. EOS It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. EOS Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!' EOS 'Then, if your lot had been differently cast,' rejoined Rose; 'if you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial. EOS I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.' EOS 'I must leave you now, indeed.' EOS 'I ask one promise,' said Harry. EOS 'Once, and only once more,--say within a year, but it may be much sooner,--I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.' EOS 'Not to press me to alter my right determination,' replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; 'it will be useless.' EOS I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.' EOS But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room. EOS 'Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!' EOS 'I hope I may have good cause to do so,' replied Mr. Losberne; 'though I confess I don't think I shall. EOS But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. EOS Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London. EOS And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds. EOS 'I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,' rejoined Oliver. EOS 'That's a fine fellow,' said the doctor; 'you shall come and see me when you return. EOS But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?' EOS 'The great nobs,' replied Harry, 'under which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.' EOS 'Well,' said the doctor, 'you are a queer fellow. EOS But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life. EOS There's something in that. EOS Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.' EOS Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, 'We shall see,' and pursued the subject no farther. EOS 'Oliver,' said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, 'let me speak a word with you.' EOS 'You can write well now?' EOS said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm. EOS 'I hope so, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me--say once a fort-night:  every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London. EOS You understand me?' EOS 'Oh! EOS quite, sir, quite,' replied Oliver. EOS 'I would rather you did not mention it to them,' said Harry, hurrying over his words; 'because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. EOS I depend upon you.' EOS Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. EOS Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection. EOS The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on. EOS Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage. EOS 'Drive on!' EOS he cried, 'hard, fast, full gallop! EOS Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.' EOS 'Halloa!' EOS Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted. EOS 'He seems in high spirits and happy,' she said, at length. EOS 'I feared for a time he might be otherwise. EOS I was mistaken. EOS I am very, very glad.' EOS CHAPTER XXXVII  IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES  Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface. EOS A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance. EOS Nor was Mr. Bumble's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. EOS There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs. EOS The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? EOS He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches. EOS The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different! EOS Men. EOS Mere men. EOS Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine. EOS Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse. EOS Another beadle had come into power. EOS On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended. EOS 'It seems a age.' EOS Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh. EOS 'I sold myself,' said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection, 'for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. EOS Cheap, dirt cheap!' EOS 'Cheap!' EOS cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble's ear: 'you would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!' EOS Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture. EOS 'Mrs. EOS 'Well!' EOS cried the lady. EOS 'Have the goodness to look at me,' said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her. EOS (If she stands such a eye as that,' said Mr. Bumble to himself, 'she can stand anything. EOS It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. EOS Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion. EOS The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine. EOS On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed. EOS He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner. EOS inquired Mrs. Bumble. EOS '_Your_ prerogative!' EOS sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt. EOS Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears. EOS But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul; his heart was waterproof. EOS He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest:  the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health. EOS 'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering. EOS The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room. EOS This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose:  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared. EOS said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. EOS 'And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.' EOS Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what something desperate might be. EOS Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door. EOS demanded Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door. EOS 'I didn't intend to--I'm going, my dear! EOS Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. EOS But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. EOS 'Hem!' EOS said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. EOS 'These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. EOS What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?' EOS With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife. EOS 'What do _you_ do here?' EOS 'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,' replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master's humility. EOS 'Why, my dear--' urged Mr. Bumble submissively. EOS 'What business is it of yours?' EOS demanded Mrs. Bumble, again. EOS 'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,' submitted Mr. Bumble; 'but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.' EOS 'We don't want any of your interference. EOS Be off; come!' EOS Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant. EOS He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight. EOS 'All in two months!' EOS said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. EOS 'Two months! EOS No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!--'  It was too much. EOS He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty. EOS He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer. EOS It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. EOS The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak. EOS He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation. EOS Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar:  so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance. EOS It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger:  and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him. EOS Mr. Bumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold. EOS When they had encountered each other's glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence. EOS 'I see you were not,' said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; 'or you have known my name. EOS I would recommend you not to ask for it.' EOS 'I meant no harm, young man,' observed Mr. Bumble, majestically. EOS 'And have done none,' said the stranger. EOS Another silence succeeded this short dialogue:  which was again broken by the stranger. EOS 'I have seen you before, I think?' EOS said he. EOS You were beadle here, once; were you not?' EOS 'I was,' said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; 'porochial beadle.' EOS 'Just so,' rejoined the other, nodding his head. EOS 'It was in that character I saw you. EOS What are you now?' EOS 'You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?' EOS resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble's eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question. EOS 'Don't scruple to answer freely, man. EOS I know you pretty well, you see.' EOS 'I suppose, a married man,' replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, 'is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one. EOS The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell. EOS 'Fill this glass again,' he said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to the landlord. EOS 'Let it be strong and hot. EOS You like it so, I suppose?' EOS 'Not too strong,' replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough. EOS said the stranger, drily. EOS The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble's eyes. EOS 'Now listen to me,' said the stranger, after closing the door and window. EOS 'I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind. EOS I want some information from you. EOS Put up that, to begin with.' EOS As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without. EOS 'The scene, the workhouse.' EOS 'Good!' EOS 'And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves--gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot 'em in the grave!' EOS 'The lying-in room, I suppose?' EOS 'Yes,' said the stranger. EOS 'A murrain on the young devils!' EOS cried the stranger; 'I speak of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin-maker--I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it--and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed. EOS Young Twist!' EOS said Mr. Bumble; 'I remember him, of course. EOS There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'  'It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver's vices. EOS 'It's of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother. EOS 'Where is she?' EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought. EOS For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. EOS With that he rose, as if to depart. EOS Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry. EOS 'Only through me,' rejoined Mr. Bumble. EOS 'When?' EOS 'To-morrow,' rejoined Bumble. EOS I needn't tell you to be secret. EOS With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk. EOS Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night. EOS 'What do you want?' EOS cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him on the arm. EOS 'Following me?' EOS 'Monks!' EOS rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away. EOS CHAPTER XXXVIII  CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW  It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. EOS The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river. EOS The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. EOS They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination. EOS This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. EOS It was a collection of mere hovels:  some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank. EOS A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it:  and here and there an oar or coil of rope:  appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed. EOS In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind. EOS It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. EOS But it had long since gone to ruin. EOS It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down. EOS cried a voice from above. EOS 'Stand still, a minute,' cried the voice; 'I'll be with you directly.' EOS With which the head disappeared, and the door closed. EOS Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative. EOS 'Come in!' EOS he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. EOS 'Don't keep me here!' EOS Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed:  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic. EOS 'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?' EOS said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them. EOS 'We--we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him. EOS 'Cooling yourselves!' EOS 'Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man can carry about with him. EOS You won't cool yourself so easily; don't think it!' EOS 'This is the woman, is it?' EOS 'Hem! EOS That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife's caution. EOS 'You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?' EOS said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks. EOS 'I know they will always keep _one_ till it's found out,' said Monks. EOS 'And what may that be?' EOS asked the matron. EOS 'The loss of their own good name,' replied Monks. EOS 'So, by the same rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! EOS Do you understand, mistress?' EOS said Monks. EOS 'How should you?' EOS Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof. EOS He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above:  when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre. EOS he cried, shrinking back. EOS 'Hear it! EOS I hate the sound!' EOS 'These fits come over me, now and then,' said Monks, observing his alarm; 'and thunder sometimes brings them on. EOS Don't mind me now; it's all over for this once.' EOS 'Now,' said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, 'the sooner we come to our business, the better for all. EOS The woman know what it is, does she?' EOS The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it. EOS 'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something--'  'About the mother of the boy you named,' replied the matron interrupting him. EOS 'Yes.' EOS said Monks. EOS 'That's the second,' observed the woman with much deliberation. EOS 'The first is, what may the communication be worth?' EOS 'Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?' EOS 'Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,' answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify. EOS said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; 'there may be money's worth to get, eh?' EOS 'Perhaps there may,' was the composed reply. EOS 'Something that was taken from her,' said Monks. EOS 'Something that she wore. EOS Something that--'  'You had better bid,' interrupted Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'What's it worth to you?' EOS asked the woman, as collectedly as before. EOS 'It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,' replied Monks. EOS 'Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,' said the woman; 'and I'll tell you all I know. EOS exclaimed Monks, drawing back. EOS 'I spoke as plainly as I could,' replied Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it's told!' EOS 'Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,' answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed. EOS 'As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!' EOS asked Monks, hesitating. EOS 'I am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.' EOS And besides,' said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, 'Mr. EOS Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. EOS I only want a little rousing; that's all.' EOS 'You are a fool,' said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; 'and had better hold your tongue.' EOS 'So! EOS 'I thought as much, when you came in,' rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. EOS See here!' EOS He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman. EOS 'Now,' he said, 'gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let's hear your story.' EOS The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. EOS The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme. EOS 'When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,' the matron began, 'she and I were alone.' EOS 'Was there no one by?' EOS No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?' EOS 'Not a soul,' replied the woman; 'we were alone. EOS _I_ stood alone beside the body when death came over it.' EOS 'Good,' said Monks, regarding her attentively. EOS 'Go on.' EOS said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, 'Blood! EOS How things come about!' EOS 'The child was the one you named to him last night,' said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; 'the mother this nurse had robbed.' EOS 'In life?' EOS asked Monks. EOS 'She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant's sake.' EOS 'She sold it,' cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; 'did she sell it? EOS 'As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,' said the matron, 'she fell back and died.' EOS cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. EOS I'll not be played with. EOS She said more. EOS 'For what?' EOS said the woman. EOS 'I judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker's interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. EOS Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. EOS 'Where is it now?' EOS asked Monks quickly. EOS And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands. EOS It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring. EOS 'It has the word "Agnes" engraved on the inside,' said the woman. EOS 'There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. EOS I found out that.' EOS said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet. EOS Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue. EOS 'I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,' said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; 'and I want to know nothing; for it's safer not. EOS But I may ask you two questions, may I?' EOS 'You may ask,' said Monks, with some show of surprise; 'but whether I answer or not is another question.' EOS '--Which makes three,' observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness. EOS demanded the matron. EOS 'It is,' replied Monks. EOS 'The other question?' EOS 'What do you propose to do with it? EOS 'Never,' rejoined Monks; 'nor against me either. EOS See here! EOS But don't move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.' EOS With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation. EOS 'Look down,' said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. EOS 'Don't fear me. EOS I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.' EOS Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. EOS 'If you flung a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?' EOS said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well. EOS 'Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,' replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought. EOS Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. EOS 'There!' EOS said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. EOS We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.' EOS 'You'll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?' EOS 'I am not afraid of your wife.' EOS 'You may depend upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. EOS 'On everybody's account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. EOS Monks.' EOS 'I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,' remarked Monks. EOS 'Light your lantern! EOS And get away from here as fast as you can.' EOS He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife. EOS They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure:  looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. EOS The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside. EOS They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. EOS Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted. EOS CHAPTER XXXIX  INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER  On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was. EOS The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings. EOS It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters:  being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane. EOS Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's having gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration. EOS The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth. EOS The dog sat at the bedside:  now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention. EOS 'Not long gone seven,' said the girl. EOS 'As weak as water,' replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs. EOS Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her. EOS 'Whining are you?' EOS Don't stand snivelling there. EOS If you can't do anything better than that, cut off altogether. EOS 'What fancy have you got in your head now?' EOS growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye. EOS 'All the better for you, you have.' EOS 'No!' EOS 'Such a number of nights,' said the girl, with a touch of woman's tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: 'such a number of nights as I've been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I've seen you like yourself; you wouldn't have served me as you did just now, if you'd thought of that, would you? EOS Come, come; say you wouldn't.' EOS 'Well, then,' rejoined Mr. Sikes, 'I wouldn't. EOS 'Don't you seem to mind me. EOS demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. EOS Get up and bustle about, and don't come over me with your woman's nonsense.' EOS At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats. EOS said Fagin, looking in. EOS 'Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?' EOS replied Sikes impatiently. EOS With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient's throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes. EOS 'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,' said Mr. Dawkins; 'and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.' EOS These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry:  were not long in producing the desired effect. EOS The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow:  leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance. EOS he asked Fagin. EOS Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.' EOS In compliance with Mr. Fagin's request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence. EOS 'Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,' exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; 'sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there's no occasion to pick 'em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it'll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn't work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,--oh no! EOS Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo'ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!' EOS Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried:  which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment's hesitation. EOS said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. EOS 'You'll do, Bill; you'll do now.' EOS 'Do!' EOS What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?' EOS 'Only hear him, boys!' EOS 'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.' EOS 'I never see such a jolly dog as that,' cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired. EOS 'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! EOS He'd make his fortun' on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.' EOS 'What about the other fortnight that you've left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?' EOS 'I couldn't help it, Bill. EOS I can't go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn't help it, upon my honour.' EOS 'Upon your what?' EOS growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. EOS Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.' EOS I'll pound it that you han't,' replied Sikes, with a bitter grin. EOS 'You've been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. EOS If it hadn't been for the girl, I might have died.' EOS 'There now, Bill,' remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. EOS 'If it hadn't been for the girl! EOS Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?' EOS said Nancy, coming hastily forward. EOS 'Let him be; let him be.' EOS Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make. EOS 'It's all very well,' said Mr. Sikes; 'but I must have some blunt from you to-night.' EOS 'I haven't a piece of coin about me,' replied the Jew. EOS 'Then you've got lots at home,' retorted Sikes; 'and I must have some from there.' EOS cried Fagin, holding up is hands. EOS 'I haven't so much as would--'  'I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,' said Sikes; 'but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.' EOS 'You won't do nothing of the kind,' rejoined Mr. Sikes. EOS 'The Artful's a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it. EOS Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she's gone.' EOS After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn't get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. EOS In due course, they arrived at Fagin's abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends. EOS asked Fagin. EOS You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. EOS Damme, I'm as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn't had the good natur' to amuse this youngster. EOS said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration. EOS 'Not a bit of it,' replied Mr. Chitling. EOS 'Am I, Fagin?' EOS asked Tom. EOS 'No doubt at all of that, my dear.' EOS 'And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an't it, Fagin?' EOS pursued Tom. EOS They're only jealous, Tom, because he won't give it to them.' EOS 'Ah!' EOS cried Tom, triumphantly, 'that's where it is! EOS He has cleaned me out. EOS But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can't I, Fagin?' EOS 'To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don't lose any more time. EOS Charley! EOS In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society:  and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit. EOS 'Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, 'I'll go and get you that cash, Nancy. EOS This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. EOS I never lock up my money, for I've got none to lock up, my dear--ha! EOS ha!--none to lock up. EOS It's a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. EOS Hush!' EOS The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went:  until the murmur of a man's voice reached her ears. EOS The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. EOS he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; 'it's the man I expected before; he's coming downstairs. EOS Not a word about the money while he's here, Nance. EOS He won't stop long. EOS Not ten minutes, my dear.' EOS Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without. EOS He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her. EOS 'Only one of my young people,' said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger. EOS 'Any news?' EOS inquired Fagin. EOS 'Great.' EOS asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine. EOS 'Not bad, any way,' replied Monks with a smile. EOS 'I have been prompt enough this time. EOS Let me have a word with you.' EOS The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. EOS The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her:  pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room. EOS Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest. EOS The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above. EOS Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. EOS When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone. EOS 'Why, Nance!' EOS 'Quite horrible. EOS 'Come! EOS With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand. EOS They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a 'good-night.' EOS Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. EOS After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath:  and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears. EOS That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions. EOS Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him. EOS said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face. EOS 'You look like a corpse come to life again. EOS What's the matter?' EOS 'Matter!' EOS replied the girl. EOS 'Nothing. EOS What do you look at me so hard for?' EOS 'What foolery is this?' EOS demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly. EOS What do you mean? EOS What are you thinking of?' EOS 'Of many things, Bill,' replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. EOS What odds in that?' EOS The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them. EOS 'I tell you wot it is,' said Sikes; 'if you haven't caught the fever, and got it comin' on, now, there's something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. EOS you wouldn't do that!' EOS 'Do what?' EOS asked the girl. EOS 'Now,' said the robber, 'come and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I'll alter it so, that you won't know it agin when you do want it.' EOS They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened. EOS He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. EOS 'The laudanum has taken effect at last,' murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside. EOS 'Has it long gone the half-hour?' EOS asked the girl. EOS 'It'll strike the hour in another quarter,' said the man: raising his lantern to her face. EOS 'And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,' muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street. EOS She tore along the narrow pavement:  elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses' heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like. EOS 'The woman is mad!' EOS said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away. EOS When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. EOS Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone. EOS As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven. EOS She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall. EOS She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs. EOS 'Now, young woman!' EOS said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, 'who do you want here?' EOS was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. EOS 'What lady?' EOS 'Miss Maylie,' said Nancy. EOS The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. EOS To him, Nancy repeated her request. EOS 'What name am I to say?' EOS asked the waiter. EOS 'It's of no use saying any,' replied Nancy. EOS 'I must see the lady.' EOS 'Come!' EOS 'None of this. EOS said the girl violently; 'and I can make that a job that two of you won't like to do. EOS This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere. EOS 'Take it up for her, Joe; can't you?' EOS 'You don't suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?' EOS 'Do what you like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again; 'but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty's sake.' EOS The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery. EOS 'What's it to be?' EOS said the man, with one foot on the stairs. EOS 'That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,' said Nancy; 'and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.' EOS 'You give the message,' said the girl firmly; 'and let me hear the answer.' EOS Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs. EOS 'It's no good being proper in this world,' said the first housemaid. EOS 'Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,' said the second. EOS The third contented herself with wondering 'what ladies was made of'; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of 'Shameful!' EOS But struggling with these better feelings was pride,--the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured. EOS The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,--even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child. EOS She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said:  'It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady. EOS If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you'd have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.' EOS 'I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,' replied Rose. EOS 'Do not think of that. EOS I am the person you inquired for.' EOS The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears. EOS 'Oh, lady, lady!' EOS she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, 'if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,--there would--there would!' EOS 'Sit down,' said Rose, earnestly. EOS 'If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,--I shall indeed. EOS Is--is--that door shut?' EOS 'Yes,' said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it. EOS 'Why?' EOS 'Because,' said the girl, 'I am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands. EOS I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin's on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.' EOS 'You!' EOS 'I, lady!' EOS replied the girl. EOS I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. EOS The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.' EOS 'What dreadful things are these!' EOS I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.' EOS 'Heaven bless you for your goodness!' EOS 'If you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. EOS Do you know a man named Monks?' EOS 'No,' said Rose. EOS 'Then he goes by some other amongst us,' rejoined the girl, 'which I more than thought before. EOS Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this man--listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. EOS I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about, you know--'  'Yes,' said Rose, 'I understand.' EOS A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.' EOS 'For what purpose?' EOS asked Rose. EOS 'He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,' said the girl; 'and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. EOS But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.' EOS 'And what occurred then?' EOS 'I'll tell you, lady. EOS Last night he came again. EOS They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil's money safely now, he'd rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.' EOS 'What is all this!' EOS 'Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy's life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn't, he'd be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. EOS "In short, Fagin," he says, "Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver."' EOS 'His brother!' EOS 'Those were his words,' said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually. EOS 'And more. EOS When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.' EOS 'He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,' replied the girl, shaking her head. EOS 'He is an earnest man when his hatred is up. EOS 'But what can I do?' EOS said Rose. EOS 'To what use can I turn this communication without you? EOS If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour's delay.' EOS 'I wish to go back,' said the girl. EOS 'I must go back, because--how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?--because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can't leave:  no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.' EOS 'Your having interfered in this dear boy's behalf before,' said Rose; 'your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed. EOS said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face, 'do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first--the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion. EOS Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.' EOS 'Lady,' cried the girl, sinking on her knees, 'dear, sweet, angel lady, you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!' EOS 'It is never too late,' said Rose, 'for penitence and atonement.' EOS I could not be his death.' EOS 'Why should you be?' EOS 'Nothing could save him,' cried the girl. EOS 'If I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. EOS He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!' EOS 'I don't know what it is,' answered the girl; 'I only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself. EOS I must go back. EOS Whether it is God's wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.' EOS said Rose. EOS 'I should not let you depart from me thus.' EOS 'You should, lady, and I know you will,' rejoined the girl, rising. EOS 'You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.' EOS said Rose. EOS 'This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?' EOS 'You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,' rejoined the girl. EOS 'But where can I find you again when it is necessary?' EOS 'I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?' EOS 'Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?' EOS asked the girl. EOS 'Stay another moment,' interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door. EOS You have a claim on me:  not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption. EOS Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you? EOS What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? EOS Oh! EOS is there no chord in your heart that I can touch! EOS 'When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,' replied the girl steadily, 'give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them. EOS When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? EOS Pity us, lady--pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.' EOS 'You will,' said Rose, after a pause, 'take some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet again?' EOS 'Not a penny,' replied the girl, waving her hand. EOS 'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,' said Rose, stepping gently forward. EOS God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!' EOS Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts. EOS CHAPTER XLI  CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE  Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. EOS While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver's history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. EOS Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope. EOS It was now midnight of the first day. EOS What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? EOS Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion? EOS Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no experienced person. EOS As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason. EOS Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away. EOS Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. EOS I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.' EOS And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep. EOS She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm. EOS 'What makes you look so flurried?' EOS asked Rose, advancing to meet him. EOS 'I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,' replied the boy. EOS 'Oh dear! EOS 'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, 'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.' EOS 'Where?' EOS asked Rose. EOS 'Getting out of a coach,' replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, 'and going into a house. EOS But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did. EOS What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!' EOS 'Quick!' EOS 'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me. EOS I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss of time. EOS Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. EOS When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. EOS The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. EOS Be seated, pray.' EOS Brownlow, I believe, sir?' EOS 'That is my name,' said the old gentleman. EOS 'This is my friend, Mr. Grimwig. EOS 'I believe,' interposed Miss Maylie, 'that at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. EOS If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.' EOS Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again. EOS 'Indeed!' EOS said Mr. Brownlow. EOS Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner. EOS He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie's, and said,  'Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven's name put me in possession of it.' EOS I'll eat my head if he is not a bad one,' growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face. EOS 'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,' said Rose, colouring; 'and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.' EOS 'I'm only sixty-one,' said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. EOS 'And, as the devil's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don't see the application of that remark.' EOS 'Yes, he does,' growled Mr. Grimwig. EOS 'No, he does not,' said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke. EOS 'He'll eat his head, if he doesn't,' growled Mr. Grimwig. EOS Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom. EOS 'Thank God!' EOS 'This is great happiness to me, great happiness. EOS You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have brought him?' EOS cried the old gentleman. EOS After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface. EOS 'Don't be afraid. EOS I'm old enough to be your grandfather. EOS You're a sweet girl. EOS I like you. EOS In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid. EOS 'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,' said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. EOS 'Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.' EOS The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders. EOS 'Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily. EOS 'Well, that I do, sir,' replied the old lady. EOS The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. EOS But Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms. EOS 'God be good to me!' EOS cried the old lady, embracing him; 'it is my innocent boy!' EOS cried Oliver. EOS Where have you been, this long, long while? EOS the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. EOS I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.' EOS Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns. EOS The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. EOS These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home. EOS Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies. EOS 'Then what the devil is to be done?' EOS said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies. EOS 'Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?' EOS 'I'd send them one and all to--'  'Never mind where,' interposed Mr. Brownlow. EOS asked the doctor. EOS 'Simply, the discovery of Oliver's parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.' EOS 'Ah!' EOS said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief; 'I almost forgot that.' EOS 'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to Oliver's, which is the same thing.' EOS 'How?' EOS inquired the doctor. EOS 'Thus. EOS It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees. EOS That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. EOS For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him. EOS 'Then,' said the doctor impetuously, 'I put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really--'  'Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,' said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. EOS 'The promise shall be kept. EOS But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him. EOS She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. EOS I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.' EOS Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried unanimously. EOS 'I should like,' he said, 'to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. EOS He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.' EOS 'I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,' said the doctor. EOS 'We must put it to the vote,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'who may he be?' EOS Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee. EOS 'We stay in town, of course,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success. EOS 'Good!' EOS 'And as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. EOS Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough. EOS Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.' EOS CHAPTER XLII  AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS  Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention. EOS They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female:  for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,--looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys. EOS The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back. EOS Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough. EOS Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion,  'Come on, can't yer? EOS 'It's a heavy load, I can tell you,' said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue. EOS 'Heavy! EOS What are yer made for?' EOS rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder. EOS 'Oh, there yer are, resting again! EOS Well, if yer ain't enough to tire anybody's patience out, I don't know what is!' EOS asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face. EOS 'Much farther! EOS Yer as good as there,' said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him. EOS 'They're a good two mile off, at least,' said the woman despondingly. EOS As Noah's red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side. EOS 'Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?' EOS 'How should I know?' EOS replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking. EOS 'Near, I hope,' said Charlotte. EOS 'No, not near,' replied Mr. Claypole. EOS 'There! EOS 'Why not?' EOS 'When I tell yer that I don't mean to do a thing, that's enough, without any why or because either,' replied Mr. Claypole with dignity. EOS 'Well, you needn't be so cross,' said his companion. EOS I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. EOS 'Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I've got a head; for if we hadn't gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer'd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. EOS And serve yer right for being a fool.' EOS 'I know I ain't as cunning as you are,' replied Charlotte; 'but don't put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. EOS You would have been if I had been, any way.' EOS 'Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,' said Mr. Claypole. EOS 'I took it for you, Noah, dear,' rejoined Charlotte. EOS 'Did I keep it?' EOS asked Mr. Claypole. EOS Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together. EOS In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest. EOS At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night. EOS What's the name of the house--t-h-r--three what?' EOS 'Cripples,' said Charlotte. EOS 'Three Cripples,' repeated Noah, 'and a very good sign too. EOS Now, then! EOS With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion. EOS There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. EOS He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him. EOS If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy's dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house. EOS 'Is this the Three Cripples?' EOS asked Noah. EOS 'That is the dabe of this 'ouse,' replied the Jew. EOS 'A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,' said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise. EOS 'We want to sleep here to-night.' EOS 'I'b dot certaid you cad,' said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; 'but I'll idquire.' EOS said Noah. EOS Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation. EOS The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening's business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils. EOS 'Hush!' EOS said Barney:  'stradegers id the next roob.' EOS 'Strangers!' EOS Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest. EOS Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure. EOS He'd be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. EOS Don't make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear 'em talk--let me hear 'em.' EOS 'So I mean to be a gentleman,' said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear. EOS 'No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman's life for me:  and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.' EOS 'Tills be blowed!' EOS said Mr. Claypole; 'there's more things besides tills to be emptied.' EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS asked his companion. EOS 'Pockets, women's ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!' EOS 'But you can't do all that, dear,' said Charlotte. EOS 'I shall look out to get into company with them as can,' replied Noah. EOS Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.' EOS 'Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!' EOS 'There, that'll do:  don't yer be too affectionate, in case I'm cross with yer,' said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. EOS 'I should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of 'em, and follering 'em about, unbeknown to themselves. EOS That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you've got,--especially as we don't very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.' EOS The stranger was Mr. Fagin. EOS And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney. EOS 'A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,' said Fagin, rubbing his hands. EOS 'From the country, I see, sir?' EOS 'How do yer see that?' EOS asked Noah Claypole. EOS 'Yer a sharp feller,' said Noah. EOS only hear that, Charlotte!' EOS 'Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,' replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; 'and that's the truth.' EOS Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose. EOS 'Good stuff that,' observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips. EOS 'Dear!' EOS said Fagin. EOS 'A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.' EOS 'Don't mind me, my dear,' said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. EOS it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. EOS 'No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear,' replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two bundles. EOS 'I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.' EOS 'In that way of business,' rejoined Fagin; 'and so are the people of the house. EOS You've hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be. EOS Noah Claypole's mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions:  eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion. EOS 'I'll tell you more,' said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. EOS 'I have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.' EOS 'Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,' replied Noah. EOS 'What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?' EOS inquired Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. EOS 'There's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,' said Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. EOS Charlotte, see to them bundles.' EOS This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out. EOS 'She's kept tolerably well under, ain't she?' EOS he asked as he resumed his seat:  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal. EOS 'Quite perfect,' rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. EOS 'You're a genius, my dear.' EOS 'Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I shouldn't be here,' replied Noah. EOS 'Now, what do you think?' EOS said Fagin. EOS 'If you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?' EOS 'Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!' EOS responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes. EOS 'Regular town-maders?' EOS asked Mr. Claypole. EOS 'Should I have to hand over?' EOS 'It couldn't possibly be done without,' replied Fagin, in a most decided manner. EOS 'Twenty pound, though--it's a lot of money!' EOS 'Not when it's in a note you can't get rid of,' retorted Fagin. EOS Payment stopped at the Bank? EOS Ah! EOS It'll have to go abroad, and he couldn't sell it for a great deal in the market.' EOS 'To-morrow morning.' EOS 'Where?' EOS 'Here.' EOS 'Um!' EOS 'What's the wages?' EOS 'Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits free--half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,' replied Mr. Fagin. EOS Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him. EOS 'But, yer see,' observed Noah, 'as she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.' EOS 'Ah! EOS something of that sort,' replied Noah. EOS 'What do you think would suit me now? EOS Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know. EOS That's the sort of thing!' EOS 'Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn't mind turning my hand to it sometimes,' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; 'but it wouldn't pay by itself, you know.' EOS 'That's true!' EOS 'No, it might not.' EOS 'What do you think, then?' EOS asked Noah, anxiously regarding him. EOS 'Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.' EOS 'What do you think of the old ladies?' EOS 'There's a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.' EOS asked Noah, shaking his head. EOS 'I don't think that would answer my purpose. EOS 'Stop!' EOS said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah's knee. EOS 'The kinchin lay.' EOS demanded Mr. Claypole. EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS 'Ha! EOS ha!' EOS ha!' EOS With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud. EOS 'Well, that's all right!' EOS 'What time to-morrow shall we say?' EOS 'Will ten do?' EOS asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent, 'What name shall I tell my good friend.' EOS 'Mr. EOS Bolter,' replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency. EOS Morris Bolter. EOS This is Mrs. EOS Bolter.' EOS thundered Mr. Claypole. EOS 'Yes, Noah, dear!' EOS 'You understand?' EOS 'Oh yes, I understand--perfectly,' replied Fagin, telling the truth for once. EOS 'Good-night! EOS Good-night!' EOS With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. EOS Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity. EOS CHAPTER XLIII  WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE  'And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?' EOS asked Mr. Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between them, he had removed next day to Fagin's house. EOS ''Cod, I thought as much last night!' EOS 'Every man's his own friend, my dear,' replied Fagin, with his most insinuating grin. EOS 'He hasn't as good a one as himself anywhere.' EOS 'Except sometimes,' replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of the world. EOS 'Don't believe that,' said Fagin. EOS 'When a man's his own enemy, it's only because he's too much his own friend; not because he's careful for everybody but himself. EOS Pooh! EOS pooh! EOS 'That stands to reason. EOS 'Ha! EOS 'Number one for ever.' EOS 'In a little community like ours, my dear,' said Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position, 'we have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.' EOS 'Oh, the devil!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Bolter. EOS 'You see,' pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, 'we are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so. EOS For instance, it's your object to take care of number one--meaning yourself.' EOS 'Certainly,' replied Mr. Bolter. EOS 'Yer about right there.' EOS 'Well! EOS 'Number two, you mean,' said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness. EOS 'No, I don't!' EOS retorted Fagin. EOS 'I'm of the same importance to you, as you are to yourself.' EOS 'I say,' interrupted Mr. Bolter, 'yer a very nice man, and I'm very fond of yer; but we ain't quite so thick together, as all that comes to.' EOS 'Only think,' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his hands; 'only consider. EOS You've done what's a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that's so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose--in plain English, the halter!' EOS Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance. EOS 'Of course it is,' replied Mr. Bolter. EOS 'Only to show you my meaning clearly,' said the Jew, raising his eyebrows. EOS 'To be able to do that, you depend upon me. EOS The first is your number one, the second my number one. EOS 'That's true,' rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. EOS 'Oh! EOS 'My best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.' EOS 'You don't mean to say he died?' EOS cried Mr. Bolter. EOS 'What, I suppose he was--'  'Wanted,' interposed Fagin. EOS 'Yes, he was wanted.' EOS 'Very particular?' EOS inquired Mr. Bolter. EOS He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,--his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. EOS Ah! EOS 'Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don't yer think so?' EOS said Mr. Bolter. EOS 'If they don't get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's a case of lagging. EOS They know what a clever lad he is; he'll be a lifer. EOS 'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?' EOS 'What's the good of talking in that way to me; why don't yer speak so as I can understand yer?' EOS Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words, 'transportation for life,' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe. EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS I never thought he'd a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. EOS With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency. EOS exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. EOS 'Wasn't he always the top-sawyer among you all! EOS Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent! EOS Eh?' EOS 'Not one,' replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; 'not one.' EOS ''Cause it isn't on the rec-ord, is it?' EOS said Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets; ''cause it can't come out in the 'dictment; 'cause nobody will never know half of what he was. EOS How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar? EOS P'raps not be there at all. EOS Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!' EOS ha!' EOS Ain't it beautiful?' EOS Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder. EOS 'Never mind, Charley,' said Fagin soothingly; 'it'll come out, it'll be sure to come out. EOS They'll all know what a clever fellow he was; he'll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. EOS Think how young he is too! EOS What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!' EOS said Charley, a little consoled. EOS 'He shall have all he wants,' continued the Jew. EOS 'He shall be kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. EOS Like a gentleman! EOS With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can't spend it.' EOS 'No, shall he though?' EOS 'Ay, that he shall,' replied Fagin, 'and we'll have a big-wig, Charley: one that's got the greatest gift of the gab:  to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we'll read it all in the papers--"Artful Dodger--shrieks of laughter--here the court was convulsed"--eh, Charley, eh?' EOS 'Ha! EOS ha!' EOS laughed Master Bates, 'what a lark that would be, wouldn't it, Fagin? EOS cried Fagin. EOS 'He shall--he will!' EOS 'So do I,' cried Charley Bates. EOS 'Ha! EOS ha! EOS so do I.  I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. EOS All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of 'em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge's own son making a speech arter dinner--ha! EOS ha! EOS ha!' EOS 'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,' said Fagin. EOS 'Shall I go?' EOS asked Charley. EOS 'Not for the world,' replied Fagin. EOS 'Are you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you'd walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no. EOS 'You don't mean to go yourself, I suppose?' EOS said Charley with a humorous leer. EOS 'That wouldn't quite fit,' replied Fagin shaking his head. EOS 'Then why don't you send this new cove?' EOS asked Master Bates, laying his hand on Noah's arm. EOS 'Nobody knows him.' EOS 'Why, if he didn't mind--' observed Fagin. EOS 'Mind!' EOS 'What should he have to mind?' EOS 'Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,' observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. EOS 'No, no--none of that. EOS 'Wot department has he got, Fagin?' EOS 'The cutting away when there's anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there's everything right; is that his branch?' EOS Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will. EOS By Fagin's directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles the Jew had at hand. EOS Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection. EOS Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting. EOS Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which--Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way. EOS He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice. EOS A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman 'Take that baby out,' when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother's shawl, from some meagre infant. EOS There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock--the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it. EOS Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character's mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. EOS It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that 'ere disgraceful sitivation for. EOS said the jailer. EOS 'I'm an Englishman, ain't I?' EOS 'You'll get your privileges soon enough,' retorted the jailer, 'and pepper with 'em.' EOS 'We'll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don't,' replied Mr. Dawkins. EOS 'Now then! EOS Wot is this here business? EOS I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I've got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he'll go away if I ain't there to my time, and then pr'aps ther won't be an action for damage against them as kep me away. EOS Oh no, certainly not!' EOS Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request. EOS 'Silence there!' EOS 'What is this?' EOS inquired one of the magistrates. EOS 'A pick-pocketing case, your worship.' EOS 'Has the boy ever been here before?' EOS 'He has been pretty well everywhere else. EOS _I_ know him well, your worship.' EOS 'Oh! EOS you know me, do you?' EOS 'Wery good. EOS That's a case of deformation of character, any way.' EOS Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence. EOS 'Now then, where are the witnesses?' EOS said the clerk. EOS 'Ah! EOS that's right,' added the Dodger. EOS 'Where are they? EOS This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance. EOS For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the lid. EOS This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. EOS He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him. EOS 'Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?' EOS said the magistrate. EOS 'Have you anything to say at all?' EOS 'Do you hear his worship ask if you've anything to say?' EOS inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow. EOS 'Did you redress yourself to me, my man?' EOS 'I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,' observed the officer with a grin. EOS 'Do you mean to say anything, you young shaver?' EOS 'No,' replied the Dodger, 'not here, for this ain't the shop for justice:  besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and 'spectable circle of acquaintance as'll make them beaks wish they'd never been born, or that they'd got their footmen to hang 'em up to their own hat-pegs, afore they let 'em come out this morning to try it on upon me. EOS I'll--'  'There! EOS He's fully committed!' EOS interposed the clerk. EOS 'Take him away.' EOS 'Come on,' said the jailer. EOS 'Oh ah! EOS I'll come on,' replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand. EOS (to the Bench) it's no use your looking frightened; I won't show you no mercy, not a ha'porth of it. EOS _You'll_ pay for this, my fine fellers. EOS I wouldn't be you for something! EOS I wouldn't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me. EOS Take me away!' EOS Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. EOS After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person. EOS The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation. EOS CHAPTER XLIV  THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. EOS Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. EOS Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last--richly as he merited such a fate--by her hand. EOS But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration. EOS Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her--and what more could she do! EOS She was resolved. EOS Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. EOS She grew pale and thin, even within a few days. EOS 'An hour this side of midnight,' said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat. EOS A good night for business this.' EOS 'What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there's none quite ready to be done.' EOS 'It is a pity, for I'm in the humour too.' EOS Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly. EOS That's all I know,' said Sikes. EOS 'It does me good to hear you.' EOS 'Does you good, does it!' EOS cried Sikes. EOS 'Ha! EOS ha! EOS ha!' EOS laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession. EOS Quite like yourself.' EOS 'It make you nervous, Bill,--reminds you of being nabbed, does it?' EOS 'There never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old 'un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn't wonder at, a bit.' EOS 'Nance. EOS 'Do you hear me?' EOS 'I don't know where,' replied the girl. EOS 'Then I do,' said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. EOS Sit down.' EOS 'I'm not well. EOS 'Put your head out of the winder,' replied Sikes. EOS 'There's not enough there,' said the girl. EOS 'Then you won't have it,' replied Sikes. EOS 'There,' said the robber. EOS 'Now stop quietly where you are, will you?' EOS 'It's not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,' said the girl turning very pale. EOS 'What do you mean, Bill? EOS Do you know what you're doing?' EOS cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, 'she's out of her senses, you know, or she daren't talk to me in that way.' EOS said Sikes. EOS He had better. EOS It'll be better for him. EOS cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground. EOS repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her. EOS And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out. EOS You don't, indeed. EOS cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, 'If I don't think the gal's stark raving mad. EOS Get up.' EOS 'Not till you let me go--not till you let me go--Never--never!' EOS Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. EOS 'Wot a precious strange gal that is!' EOS 'You may say that.' EOS 'Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?' EOS asked Sikes. EOS 'Come; you should know her better than me. EOS 'Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.' EOS 'Well, I suppose it is,' growled Sikes. EOS 'Worse,' said Fagin thoughtfully. EOS 'I never knew her like this, for such a little cause.' EOS 'Like enough.' EOS 'I'll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she's took that way again,' said Sikes. EOS Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment. EOS 'She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,' said Sikes. EOS 'We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it's worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless--eh?' EOS 'That's it, my dear,' replied the Jew in a whisper. EOS 'Hush!' EOS As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat. EOS Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing. EOS 'Why, now she's on the other tack!' EOS Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. EOS Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night. EOS He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs. EOS When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper. EOS replied the girl, in the same tone. EOS 'The reason of all this,' replied Fagin. EOS said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers. EOS 'No matter just now. EOS We'll talk of this again. EOS worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes--come to me. EOS I say, come to me. EOS He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.' EOS 'I know you well,' replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion. EOS Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain. EOS Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty. EOS He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay. EOS 'With a little persuasion,' thought Fagin, 'what more likely than that she would consent to poison him? EOS Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now. EOS These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. EOS The girl clearly comprehended it. EOS Her glance at parting showed _that_. EOS But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. EOS 'How,' thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, 'can I increase my influence with her? EOS Such brains are fertile in expedients. EOS If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance? EOS 'She durst not refuse me then. EOS Not for her life, not for her life! EOS I have it all. EOS I shall have you yet!' EOS He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers. EOS CHAPTER XLV  NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION  The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast. EOS 'Well, here I am,' returned Noah. EOS That's a great fault in this place. EOS 'You can talk as you eat, can't you?' EOS said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend's greediness from the very bottom of his heart. EOS 'Oh yes, I can talk. EOS I get on better when I talk,' said Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread. EOS 'I sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.' EOS 'Oh!' EOS said Noah. EOS 'I wish yer'd ordered her to make some buttered toast first. EOS Well. EOS Talk away. EOS Yer won't interrupt me.' EOS Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! EOS The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.' EOS 'Don't you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,' said Mr. Bolter. EOS 'No, no, my dear. EOS 'Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,' remarked Mr. Bolter complacently. EOS 'The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house. EOS I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know. EOS ha!' EOS Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second. EOS That don't suit me, that don't; and so I tell yer.' EOS 'An old woman?' EOS demanded Mr. Bolter. EOS 'A young one,' replied Fagin. EOS 'I can do that pretty well, I know,' said Bolter. EOS 'I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school. EOS What am I to dodge her for? EOS 'What'll yer give me?' EOS 'If you do it well, a pound, my dear. EOS One pound,' said Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. EOS 'One of us.' EOS 'Oh Lor!' EOS 'Yer doubtful of her, are yer?' EOS 'She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,' replied Fagin. EOS 'I see,' said Noah. EOS 'Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they're respectable people, eh? EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS I'm your man.' EOS 'I knew you would be,' cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal. EOS 'Where is she? EOS Where am I to go?' EOS On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. EOS 'She goes abroad to-night,' said Fagin, 'and on the right errand, I'm sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak. EOS Come with me. EOS Quick!' EOS Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him. EOS It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed. EOS It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. EOS They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them. EOS Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room. EOS 'She is looking down, and the candle is behind her. EOS 'Stay there,' whispered Fagin. EOS He signed to Barney, who withdrew. EOS In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face. EOS 'I see her now,' cried the spy. EOS He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. EOS 'Hist!' EOS cried the lad who held the door. EOS Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out. EOS 'To the left,' whispered the lad; 'take the left had, and keep od the other side.' EOS He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions. EOS She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on. EOS The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed:  with his eye upon her. EOS CHAPTER XLVI  THE APPOINTMENT KEPT  The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. EOS One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers:  stopping when she stopped:  and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on:  but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. EOS Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back. EOS The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. EOS At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. EOS The man stopped too. EOS The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring. EOS Such as there were, hurried quickly past:  very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. EOS Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London's destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:  neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed. EOS A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. EOS The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. EOS The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro--closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer--when the heavy bell of St. Paul's tolled for the death of another day. EOS The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it. EOS They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. EOS They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up--brushed against them, indeed--at that precise moment. EOS As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on. EOS These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. EOS Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. EOS At this point the lower steps widen:  so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. EOS The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited:  pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety. EOS 'This is far enough,' said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman. EOS 'I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. EOS Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.' EOS cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed. EOS 'You're considerate, indeed, sir. EOS To humour me! EOS Well, well, it's no matter.' EOS Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?' EOS asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her. EOS Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. EOS 'No imagination,' replied the girl in a hoarse voice. EOS 'I'll swear I saw "coffin" written in every page of the book in large black letters,--aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.' EOS 'There is nothing unusual in that,' said the gentleman. EOS 'They have passed me often.' EOS '_Real ones_,' rejoined the girl. EOS 'This was not.' EOS There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him. EOS 'Poor creature! EOS She seems to need it.' EOS 'Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,' cried the girl. EOS 'Oh, dear lady, why ar'n't those who claim to be God's own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?' EOS 'Ah!' EOS Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!' EOS These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself. EOS The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her. EOS 'You were not here last Sunday night,' he said. EOS 'By whom?' EOS 'You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?' EOS asked the old gentleman. EOS 'No,' replied the girl, shaking her head. EOS 'It's not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn't give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.' EOS inquired the gentleman. EOS 'No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.' EOS 'Good,' said the gentleman. EOS 'This young lady,' the gentleman began, 'has communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since. EOS I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.' EOS 'I am,' said the girl earnestly. EOS To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. EOS But if--if--' said the gentleman, 'he cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.' EOS I will never do it!' EOS replied the girl. EOS said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer. EOS 'Never!' EOS returned the girl. EOS 'Tell me why?' EOS 'For one reason,' rejoined the girl firmly, 'for one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise:  and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I'll not turn upon them, who might--any of them--have turned upon me, but didn't, bad as they are.' EOS 'What if he turns against the others?' EOS 'I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver's little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.' EOS 'And if it is not?' EOS 'Have I the lady's promise for that?' EOS asked the girl. EOS 'My true and faithful pledge.' EOS said the girl, after a short pause. EOS 'Never,' replied the gentleman. EOS After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night. EOS When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection. EOS 'He is tall,' said the girl, 'and a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. EOS Don't forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man's, that you might almost tell him by that alone. EOS His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds--why did you start?' EOS said the girl, stopping suddenly. EOS 'Part of this,' said the girl, 'I have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak. EOS I think that's all I can give you to know him by. EOS Stay though,' she added. EOS cried the gentleman. EOS The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe. EOS 'I should by your description. EOS It may not be the same.' EOS As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, 'It must be he!' EOS 'Now,' he said, returning:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the spot where he had stood before, 'you have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. EOS What can I do to serve you?' EOS Tell me.' EOS 'Nothing, sir,' rejoined the girl, weeping. EOS 'You can do nothing to help me. EOS 'You put yourself beyond its pale,' said the gentleman. EOS I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you. EOS Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!' EOS 'She hesitates, I am sure.' EOS 'I fear not, my dear,' said the gentleman. EOS 'No sir, I do not,' replied the girl, after a short struggle. EOS 'I am chained to my old life. EOS But,' she said, looking hastily round, 'this fear comes over me again. EOS I must go home.' EOS repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word. EOS I shall be watched or seen. EOS Go! EOS Go! EOS 'It is useless,' said the gentleman, with a sigh. EOS 'We compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here. EOS 'Yes, yes,' urged the girl. EOS 'You have.' EOS 'What,' cried the young lady, 'can be the end of this poor creature's life!' EOS 'What!' EOS repeated the girl. EOS 'Look before you, lady. EOS Look at that dark water. EOS It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.' EOS 'It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!' EOS replied the girl. EOS 'Good-night, good-night!' EOS The gentleman turned away. EOS 'This purse,' cried the young lady. EOS 'Take it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.' EOS 'No!' EOS replied the girl. EOS 'I have not done this for money. EOS And yet--give me something that you have worn:  I should like to have something--no, no, not a ring--your gloves or handkerchief--anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady. EOS Bless you! EOS Good-night, good-night!' EOS The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased. EOS cried the young lady, listening. EOS 'Did she call! EOS I thought I heard her voice.' EOS Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away. EOS As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears. EOS After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street. EOS The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended. EOS CHAPTER XLVII  FATAL CONSEQUENCES  It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit. EOS He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side. EOS Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. EOS Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere. EOS Indeed they were. EOS Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart. EOS He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street. EOS 'At last,' he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. EOS Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes. EOS he said, laying the bundle on the table. EOS 'Take care of that, and do the most you can with it. EOS Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking. EOS But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright. EOS 'Wot now?' EOS cried Sikes. EOS 'Wot do you look at a man so for?' EOS Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone. EOS 'Damme!' EOS I must look to myself here.' EOS 'No, no,' rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. EOS 'It's not--you're not the person, Bill. EOS I've no--no fault to find with you.' EOS 'Oh, you haven't, haven't you?' EOS 'I've got that to tell you, Bill,' said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer, 'will make you worse than me.' EOS returned the robber with an incredulous air. EOS Look sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.' EOS 'Lost!' EOS cried Fagin. EOS 'She has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.' EOS Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly. EOS 'Speak, will you!' EOS he said; 'or if you don't, it shall be for want of breath. EOS Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words. EOS Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!' EOS 'Suppose that lad that's laying there--' Fagin began. EOS Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him. EOS 'Well!' EOS Do you hear me?' EOS cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage. EOS 'What then!' EOS 'What if I did it!' EOS cried Fagin almost in a yell. EOS 'I, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!' EOS 'I'd do something in the jail that 'ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I'd fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. EOS I should have such strength,' muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, 'that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.' EOS 'You would?' EOS 'Would I!' EOS said the housebreaker. EOS 'If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--'  'I don't care who,' replied Sikes impatiently. EOS 'Whoever it was, I'd serve them the same.' EOS Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him. EOS Sikes leant forward in his chair:  looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in. EOS 'Bolter, Bolter! EOS said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis. EOS 'He's tired--tired with watching for her so long,--watching for _her_, Bill.' EOS asked Sikes, drawing back. EOS Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture. EOS 'Tell me that again--once again, just for him to hear,' said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke. EOS asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly. EOS 'Yes.' EOS 'Yes.' EOS 'A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did--and to describe him, which she did--and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did--and where it could be best watched from, which she did--and what time the people went there, which she did. EOS She did all this. EOS cried Fagin, half mad with fury. EOS 'All right,' replied Noah, scratching his head. EOS 'That's just what it was!' EOS 'What did they say, about last Sunday?' EOS 'Why I told yer that before.' EOS Tell it again!' EOS cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips. EOS 'Why--why? EOS cried Fagin. EOS 'What more of the man she had told them of before? EOS Tell him that, tell him that.' EOS 'Why, that she couldn't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,' said Noah; 'and so the first time she went to see the lady, she--ha! EOS ha! EOS it made me laugh when she said it, that it did--she gave him a drink of laudanum.' EOS 'Hell's fire!' EOS 'Let me go!' EOS Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs. EOS 'Bill, Bill!' EOS 'A word. EOS 'Don't speak to me; it's not safe. EOS 'Hear me speak a word,' rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock. EOS 'You won't be--'  'Well,' replied the other. EOS 'You won't be--too--violent, Bill?' EOS Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets. EOS The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. EOS He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look. EOS 'Get up!' EOS 'It is,' was the reply. EOS There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. EOS Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain. EOS 'Let it be,' said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. EOS 'Bill,' said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, 'why do you look like that at me!' EOS The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth. EOS 'Bill, Bill!' EOS gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,--'I--I won't scream or cry--not once--hear me--speak to me--tell me what I have done!' EOS 'You know, you she devil!' EOS returned the robber, suppressing his breath. EOS 'Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,' rejoined the girl, clinging to him. EOS think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you. EOS I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!' EOS The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away. EOS Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more. EOS It is never too late to repent. EOS They told me so--I feel it now--but we must have time--a little, little time!' EOS The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. EOS The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own. EOS She staggered and fell:  nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief--Rose Maylie's own--and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker. EOS The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down. EOS Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel. EOS The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory. EOS Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. EOS It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. EOS It did. EOS There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again. EOS Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. EOS He had plucked it off again. EOS And there was the body--mere flesh and blood, no more--but such flesh, and so much blood! EOS There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. EOS He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. EOS How those stains were dispersed about the room! EOS All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment. EOS It lay nearly under there. EOS God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot! EOS It was a relief to have got free of the room. EOS Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept. EOS Soon he was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but back towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed--then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches' brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again. EOS Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink? EOS That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people's way. EOS Thither he directed his steps,--running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail's pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. EOS But when he got there, all the people he met--the very children at the doors--seemed to view him with suspicion. EOS Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go. EOS He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place. EOS Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot. EOS At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield. EOS There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it. EOS The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young--not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was--with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least--if he had taken care; if he had taken care. EOS The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer. EOS This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back. EOS His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement. EOS 'And what be that stoof? EOS 'This,' said the fellow, producing one, 'this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff. EOS If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question--for it's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. EOS One penny a square. EOS With all these virtues, one penny a square!' EOS There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated. EOS The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity. EOS 'It's all bought up as fast as it can be made,' said the fellow. EOS One penny a square! EOS Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy. EOS Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! EOS Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I'll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.' EOS 'Hah!' EOS cried Sikes starting up. EOS Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman's hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown. EOS With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office. EOS He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened. EOS 'That's for your people,' said the guard. EOS 'Now, look alive in there, will you. EOS Damn that 'ere bag, it warn't ready night afore last; this won't do, you know!' EOS 'Anything new up in town, Ben?' EOS asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses. EOS 'No, nothing that I knows on,' replied the man, pulling on his gloves. EOS 'Corn's up a little. EOS I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don't reckon much upon it.' EOS 'And a dreadful murder it was.' EOS 'Was it, sir?' EOS rejoined the guard, touching his hat. EOS 'A woman,' replied the gentleman. EOS 'It is supposed--'  'Now, Ben,' replied the coachman impatiently. EOS 'Coming!' EOS cried the office keeper, running out. EOS 'Coming,' growled the guard. EOS 'Ah, and so's the young 'ooman of property that's going to take a fancy to me, but I don't know when. EOS Here, give hold. EOS All ri--ight!' EOS The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone. EOS At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans. EOS He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core. EOS Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning's ghastly figure following at his heels. EOS He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry. EOS If he stopped it did the same. EOS If he ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a relief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell. EOS At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then. EOS He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now--always. EOS He threw himself upon the road--on his back upon the road. EOS At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood. EOS Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep. EOS There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear. EOS There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night. EOS Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. EOS For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped. EOS There were but two, but they were everywhere. EOS If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object--some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed place. EOS The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away. EOS He got up, and rushed into the field without. EOS He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. EOS The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along. EOS And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. EOS Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him. EOS He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air. EOS The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! EOS The noise increased as he looked. EOS There were people there--men and women--light, bustle. EOS He darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him. EOS There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams. EOS The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground. EOS Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. EOS The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. EOS He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng. EOS Hither and thither he dived that night:  now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. EOS He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk. EOS The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together. EOS He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. EOS He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. EOS He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. EOS He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night. EOS Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London. EOS 'There's somebody to speak to there, at all event,' he thought. EOS Why can't I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? EOS Damme, I'll risk it.' EOS He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination. EOS The dog, though. EOS This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. EOS He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went. EOS The animal looked up into his master's face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber's sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along. EOS When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright. EOS said the robber. EOS The dog wagged his tail, but moved not. EOS Sikes made a running noose and called him again. EOS The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return. EOS But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey. EOS CHAPTER XLIX  MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. EOS THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT   The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. EOS The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side. EOS This man was Monks. EOS They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. EOS At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped. EOS 'He knows the alternative,' said Mr. Browlow. EOS 'If he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.' EOS asked Monks. EOS 'How dare you urge me to it, young man?' EOS replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting him with a steady look. EOS 'Are you mad enough to leave this house? EOS Unhand him. EOS You are free to go, and we to follow. EOS I am resolute and immoveable. EOS If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!' EOS 'By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?' EOS asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him. EOS 'By mine,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Those persons are indemnified by me. EOS If you complain of being deprived of your liberty--you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet--I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law. EOS I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.' EOS He hesitated. EOS 'If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way. EOS If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. EOS It has waited for you two whole days.' EOS Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still. EOS 'You will be prompt,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'A word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.' EOS Still the man hesitated. EOS 'Is there--' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--'is there--no middle course?' EOS 'None.' EOS 'Lock the door on the outside,' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, 'and come when I ring.' EOS The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together. EOS 'What has the name to do with it?' EOS asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion. EOS 'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'nothing to you. EOS But it was _hers_, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger. EOS 'But what do you want with me?' EOS 'You have a brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  'a brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.' EOS Why do you talk to me of brothers? EOS You know that, as well as I.' EOS 'I shall interest you by and by. EOS I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.' EOS 'I don't care for hard names,' interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh. EOS 'You know the fact, and that's enough for me.' EOS 'But I also know,' pursued the old gentleman, 'the misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. EOS I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume. EOS 'When they had been separated for some time,' returned Mr. Brownlow, 'and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends. EOS This circumstance, at least, you know already.' EOS 'Not I,' said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. EOS 'I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty--for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. EOS 'You must talk on if you will.' EOS asked Monks. EOS 'They resided,' said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, 'in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. EOS Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. EOS Your father was gifted as few men are. EOS I would that it had ended there. EOS His daughter did the same.' EOS 'Your tale is of the longest,' observed Monks, moving restlessly in his chair. EOS 'It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,' returned Mr. Brownlow, 'and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief. EOS At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often--it is no uncommon case--died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs--Money. EOS It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. EOS As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands. EOS 'I never heard of that,' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise. EOS He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country--I guessed too well he would not fly alone--and never see it more. EOS Alas! EOS _That_ was the last time. EOS I had no letter, and I never saw him more.' EOS 'I went,' said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, 'I went, when all was over, to the scene of his--I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him--of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. EOS The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night. EOS Why, or whither, none can tell.' EOS 'When your brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other's chair, 'When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected child:  was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy--'  'What?' EOS 'By me,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'I told you I should interest you before long. EOS I say by me--I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. EOS When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment. EOS Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. EOS I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history--'  'Why not?' EOS asked Monks hastily. EOS 'I!' EOS 'You--you--can't prove anything against me,' stammered Monks. EOS 'I defy you to do it!' EOS 'We shall see,' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. EOS 'I lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. EOS Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies--whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here--I made the voyage. EOS I returned. EOS You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done:  sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months:  keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy. EOS I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.' EOS 'And now you do see me,' said Monks, rising boldly, 'what then? EOS You don't even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don't even know that.' EOS You have a brother; you know it, and him. EOS It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father. EOS You repaired to the place of his birth. EOS There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of his birth and parentage. EOS Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, "_the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_." EOS Unworthy son, coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,--you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father's heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind--you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!' EOS 'No, no, no!' EOS returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges. EOS 'Every word!' EOS 'No, no,' interposed Monks. EOS 'I--I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. EOS I didn't know the cause. EOS I thought it was a common quarrel.' EOS 'Will you disclose the whole?' EOS 'Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?' EOS 'That I promise too.' EOS 'Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?' EOS 'If you insist upon that, I'll do that also,' replied Monks. EOS 'You must do more than that,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS You have not forgotten the provisions of the will. EOS Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please. EOS In this world you need meet no more.' EOS 'His dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness. EOS Spies are hovering about in every direction. EOS I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape. EOS Where is Mr. EOS Maylie?' EOS 'Harry? EOS 'When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time. EOS They're sure of him.' EOS 'Have you made up your mind?' EOS 'Yes,' he replied. EOS 'I will. EOS It is your only hope of safety.' EOS They left the room, and the door was again locked. EOS 'What have you done?' EOS 'All that I could hope to do, and even more. EOS Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting. EOS Which way have they taken?' EOS 'Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,' replied Mr. Losberne. EOS 'I will remain here.' EOS The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable. EOS The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman's door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows. EOS Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner. EOS In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob's Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. EOS It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name. EOS In Jacob's Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke. EOS Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. EOS The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. EOS They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob's Island. EOS This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags. EOS 'I wish,' said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, 'that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.' EOS 'Why didn't you, blunder-head!' EOS said Kags. EOS 'Why, look'e, young gentleman,' said Toby, 'when a man keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it's rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.' EOS Charley and I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.' EOS 'And Bet?' EOS She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,' replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, 'and went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital--and there she is.' EOS 'Wot's come of young Bates?' EOS demanded Kags. EOS 'There's nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken--I went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.' EOS 'There's more than one will go with this.' EOS 'The sessions are on,' said Kags:  'if they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King's evidence:  as of course he will, from what he's said already:  they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he'll swing in six days from this, by G--!' EOS 'You should have heard the people groan,' said Chitling; 'the officers fought like devils, or they'd have torn him away. EOS He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. EOS You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends. EOS The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted. EOS They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street. EOS The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen. EOS said Toby when they had returned. EOS I--I--hope not.' EOS 'Here! EOS Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.' EOS 'He's drunk it all up, every drop,' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence. EOS 'He'--(none of them called the murderer by his old name)--'He can't have made away with himself. EOS said Chitling. EOS Toby shook his head. EOS No. EOS I think he's got out of the country, and left the dog behind. EOS It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table. EOS The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position. EOS They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room. EOS They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below. EOS 'Young Bates,' said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself. EOS The knocking came again. EOS He never knocked like that. EOS Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. EOS The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door. EOS 'We must let him in,' he said, taking up the candle. EOS 'Isn't there any help for it?' EOS He _must_ come in.' EOS Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat. EOS He drew them slowly off. EOS Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days' growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes. EOS He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall--as close as it would go--and ground it against it--and sat down. EOS When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. EOS 'How came that dog here?' EOS he asked. EOS 'Alone. EOS Three hours ago.' EOS 'To-night's paper says that Fagin's took. EOS They were silent again. EOS said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead. EOS 'Have you nothing to say to me?' EOS 'You may stop here, if you think it safe,' returned the person addressed, after some hesitation. EOS Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:  rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it:  and said, 'Is--it--the body--is it buried?' EOS They shook their heads. EOS 'Why isn't it!' EOS he retorted with the same glance behind him. EOS 'Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?--Who's that knocking?' EOS Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure. EOS 'Toby,' said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, 'why didn't you tell me this, downstairs?' EOS Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him. EOS 'Let me go into some other room,' said the boy, retreating still farther. EOS said Sikes, stepping forward. EOS 'Don't you--don't you know me?' EOS 'Don't come nearer me,' answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer's face. EOS 'Witness you three--I'm not afraid of him--if they come here after him, I'll give him up; I will. EOS I tell you out at once. EOS He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I'll give him up. EOS I'd give him up if he was to be boiled alive. EOS Murder! EOS Help! EOS Down with him!' EOS Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground. EOS The three spectators seemed quite stupefied. EOS They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer's breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might. EOS The contest, however, was too unequal to last long. EOS Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window. EOS One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. EOS The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. EOS Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail. EOS 'Help!' EOS shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. EOS 'He's here! EOS Break down the door!' EOS 'In the King's name,' cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder. EOS 'Break down the door!' EOS 'I tell you they'll never open it. EOS Break down the door!' EOS Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent. EOS 'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,' cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. EOS 'That door. EOS Quick!' EOS 'Is the downstairs door fast?' EOS 'Double-locked and chained,' replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered. EOS 'The panels--are they strong?' EOS 'Lined with sheet-iron.' EOS 'Yes, and the windows.' EOS 'Damn you!' EOS cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd. EOS 'Do your worst! EOS Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng. EOS Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead. EOS Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, 'Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!' EOS The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. EOS 'The tide,' cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, 'the tide was in as I came up. EOS They're all in front. EOS I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way. EOS The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top. EOS All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body. EOS But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream. EOS He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet. EOS The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers. EOS Again and again it rose. EOS On pressed the people from the front--on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. EOS Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch. EOS 'They have him now,' cried a man on the nearest bridge. EOS 'Hurrah!' EOS 'I will give fifty pounds,' cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, 'to the man who takes him alive. EOS I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.' EOS There was another roar. EOS At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room. EOS The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:  each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. EOS The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion. EOS Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. EOS At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down--at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror. EOS 'The eyes again!' EOS he cried in an unearthly screech. EOS The noose was on his neck. EOS It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. EOS There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand. EOS The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. EOS The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God's sake. EOS A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders. EOS CHAPTER LI  AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY  The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. EOS Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him:  and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned. EOS They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree. EOS He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense. EOS The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne's assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place. EOS 'It was quite true,' he said, 'that they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.' EOS So, they travelled on in silence:  each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together:  and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all. EOS 'See there, there!' EOS Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child! EOS Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!' EOS 'You will see him soon,' replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own. EOS 'You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.' EOS 'Yes, yes,' said Oliver, 'and we'll--we'll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,--shall we?' EOS Rose nodded 'yes,' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak. EOS 'It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again--I know that too--to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. EOS He said "God bless you" to me when I ran away,' cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; 'and I will say "God bless you" now, and show him how I love him for it!' EOS As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds. EOS There was Sowerberry's the undertaker's just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it--there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected--there was Gamfield's cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street--there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again--there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well--there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream. EOS They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head--no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep. EOS There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic. EOS Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room. EOS The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart. EOS Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door. EOS Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated. EOS 'This is a painful task,' said he, 'but these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here. EOS I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.' EOS 'Go on,' said the person addressed, turning away his face. EOS 'Quick. EOS I have almost done enough, I think. EOS Don't keep me here.' EOS 'This child,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, 'is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.' EOS 'The term you use,' said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, 'is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. EOS It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. EOS Let that pass. EOS 'In the workhouse of this town,' was the sullen reply. EOS 'You have the story there.' EOS 'I must have it here, too,' said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners. EOS 'Listen then! EOS 'His father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her--to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her. EOS He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died. EOS Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself'; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; 'and enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead. EOS One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.' EOS 'What of the letter?' EOS asked Mr. Brownlow. EOS She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement. EOS I believe he had.' EOS He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the other, and his conviction--only strengthened by approaching death--that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature. EOS If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you:  for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.' EOS 'My mother,' said Monks, in a louder tone, 'did what a woman should have done. EOS The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot. EOS Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed. EOS There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative. EOS 'Years after this,' he said, 'this man's--Edward Leeford's--mother came to me. EOS He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London:  where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. EOS She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died. EOS They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to France.' EOS 'There she died,' said Monks, 'after a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved--though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. EOS She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive. EOS I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot. EOS He came in my way at last. EOS I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!' EOS said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks. EOS 'I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,' answered Monks without raising his eyes. EOS Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him. EOS cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm, 'or is that little Oliver? EOS Oh O-li-ver, if you know'd how I've been a-grieving for you--'  'Hold your tongue, fool,' murmured Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'Isn't natur, natur, Mrs. EOS 'Can't I be supposed to feel--_I_ as brought him up porochially--when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description! EOS I always loved that boy as if he'd been my--my--my own grandfather,' said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison. EOS 'Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? EOS Ah! EOS 'Come, sir,' said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; 'suppress your feelings.' EOS 'I will do my endeavours, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble. EOS This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple. EOS He inquired, as he pointed to Monks,  'Do you know that person?' EOS 'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly. EOS said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse. EOS 'You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?' EOS said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Certainly not,' replied the matron. EOS Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness. EOS But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked. EOS 'You shut the door the night old Sally died,' said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand, 'but you couldn't shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.' EOS 'We heard her try to tell you what she'd done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker's shop,' said the first. EOS We found out that, and saw it given you. EOS we were by.' EOS 'Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?' EOS asked Mr. Grimwig with a motion towards the door. EOS I _did_ sell them, and they're where you'll never get them. EOS 'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. EOS You may leave the room.' EOS 'It was all Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'That is no excuse,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.' EOS 'If the law supposes that,' said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, 'the law is a ass--a idiot. EOS If that's the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience--by experience.' EOS Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs. EOS Do not tremble. EOS 'If they have--I do not know how they can, but if they have--any reference to me,' said Rose, 'pray let me hear them at some other time. EOS I have not strength or spirits now.' EOS 'Nay,' returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; 'you have more fortitude than this, I am sure. EOS 'Yes,' replied Monks. EOS 'I never saw you before,' said Rose faintly. EOS 'I have seen you often,' returned Monks. EOS 'The father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Go on,' said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. EOS 'Go on!' EOS 'You couldn't find the spot to which these people had repaired,' said Monks, 'but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. EOS My mother found it, after a year of cunning search--ay, and found the child.' EOS 'She took it, did she?' EOS She didn't quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child's unhappiness, but told the history of the sister's shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other. EOS The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home. EOS There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy. EOS I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.' EOS 'Do you see her now?' EOS 'Yes. EOS Leaning on your arm.' EOS 'But not the less my niece,' cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; 'not the less my dearest child. EOS My sweet companion, my own dear girl!' EOS 'The only friend I ever had,' cried Rose, clinging to her. EOS 'The kindest, best of friends. EOS My heart will burst. EOS I cannot bear all this.' EOS 'You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,' said Mrs. Maylie, embracing her tenderly. EOS Rose, dear, darling Rose!' EOS A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without. EOS 'I know it all,' he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. EOS 'I am not here by accident,' he added after a lengthened silence; 'nor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday--only yesterday. EOS Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?' EOS 'All. EOS I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.' EOS 'If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night? EOS 'The disclosure of to-night,'--Harry began. EOS 'The disclosure of to-night,' replied Rose softly, 'leaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.' EOS 'You harden your heart against me, Rose,' urged her lover. EOS 'Oh Harry, Harry,' said the young lady, bursting into tears; 'I wish I could, and spare myself this pain.' EOS said Harry, taking her hand. EOS 'Think, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.' EOS cried Rose. EOS 'That a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.' EOS 'Not yet, not yet,' said the young man, detaining her as she rose. EOS 'My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling:  every thought in life except my love for you:  have undergone a change. EOS I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home--a heart and home--yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.' EOS 'What do you mean!' EOS 'I mean but this--that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it. EOS This I have done. EOS Such power and patronage:  such relatives of influence and rank:  as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England's richest county; and by one village church--mine, Rose, my own!--there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. EOS This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!' EOS *      *      *      *      *  'It's a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,' said Mr. Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head. EOS Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time. EOS 'I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'for I began to think I should get nothing else. EOS I'll take the liberty, if you'll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.' EOS Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow:  some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal:  he being young and a clergyman. EOS There are tears stealing down your face at this moment. EOS Poor Dick was dead! EOS CHAPTER LII  FAGIN'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE  The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. EOS Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. EOS From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man--Fagin. EOS Before him and behind:  above, below, on the right and on the left:  he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes. EOS He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury. EOS Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. EOS He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still. EOS Looking round, he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict. EOS But in no one face--not even among the women, of whom there were many there--could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned. EOS As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge. EOS Hush! EOS They only sought permission to retire. EOS Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot. EOS There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book. EOS He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done. EOS In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on. EOS Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it. EOS Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. EOS At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door. EOS The jury returned, and passed him close. EOS He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. EOS Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a breath--Guilty. EOS It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday. EOS The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him. EOS The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture. EOS A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. EOS The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. EOS But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. EOS His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away. EOS He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed. EOS There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars:  and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed. EOS He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison. EOS He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts. EOS After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. EOS These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more:  so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. EOS To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead--that was the end. EOS They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. EOS With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes! EOS Some of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that very spot. EOS It was very dark; why didn't they bring a light? EOS It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.--Light, light! EOS At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared:  one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall:  the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more. EOS Then came the night--dark, dismal, silent night. EOS To him they brought despair. EOS The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death. EOS It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning. EOS The day passed off. EOS Day? EOS At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. EOS They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off. EOS Saturday night. EOS He had only one night more to live. EOS And as he thought of this, the day broke--Sunday. EOS He had sat there, awake, but dreaming. EOS Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they--used to such sights--recoiled from him with horror. EOS He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. EOS Eight--nine--then. EOS Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate. EOS At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven--  Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. EOS The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him. EOS By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness. EOS The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. EOS They were immediately admitted into the lodge. EOS 'Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?' EOS said the man whose duty it was to conduct them. EOS These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. EOS The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells. EOS 'This,' said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--'this is the place he passes through. EOS If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.' EOS He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door. EOS There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men's voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards. EOS They were putting up the scaffold. EOS From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand. EOS The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. EOS The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man. EOS ha! EOS ha! EOS cried Fagin. EOS Saw his head off!' EOS 'Fagin,' said the jailer. EOS 'That's me!' EOS cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. EOS 'Here,' said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down. EOS 'Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose. EOS Are you a man?' EOS 'I shan't be one long,' he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror. EOS What right have they to butcher me?' EOS As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. EOS Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there. EOS 'Steady,' said the turnkey, still holding him down. EOS 'Now, sir, tell him what you want. EOS 'You have some papers,' said Mr. Brownlow advancing, 'which were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.' EOS 'It's all a lie together,' replied Fagin. EOS 'I haven't one--not one.' EOS You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain. EOS 'Here, here! EOS I want to talk to you.' EOS 'Yes, yes,' returned Oliver. EOS 'Let me say a prayer. EOS Do! EOS 'Outside, outside,' replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. EOS You can get me out, if you take me so. EOS Now then, now then!' EOS 'Oh! EOS God forgive this wretched man!' EOS cried the boy with a burst of tears. EOS 'That'll help us on. EOS This door first. EOS If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you mind, but hurry on. EOS inquired the turnkey. EOS 'No other question,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'You had better leave him.' EOS 'Softly, but not so slow. EOS Faster, faster!' EOS The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back. EOS Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk. EOS Day was dawning when they again emerged. EOS A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. EOS Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all--the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death. EOS CHAPTER LIII  AND LAST  The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. EOS Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman's labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home. EOS Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed. EOS It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds. EOS Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. EOS As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin's gang. EOS Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. EOS Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. EOS For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. EOS In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority. EOS Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. EOS On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one. EOS On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman's face:  always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. EOS It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour. EOS After some consideration, he went into business as an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. EOS His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. EOS Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same. EOS Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. EOS Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. EOS Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. EOS He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire. EOS I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. EOS These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech--I would fain recall them every one. EOS How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them--these are all matters which need not to be told. EOS I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained. EOS Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word:  'AGNES.' EOS There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it! EOS But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the love beyond the grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. EOS I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring. EOS The Period   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. EOS In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. EOS Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. EOS Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. EOS France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. EOS Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. EOS It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. EOS But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. EOS In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. EOS Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. EOS In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence. EOS Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. EOS Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them. EOS II. EOS The Mail   It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. EOS He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. EOS Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty. EOS As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! EOS so-ho-then!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. EOS Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind. EOS A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. EOS It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all. EOS Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. EOS Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. EOS In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. EOS Tst! EOS Yah! EOS They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. EOS If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman. EOS The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in. EOS Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box. EOS “What do you say, Tom?”  They both listened. EOS “I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”  “_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. EOS “Gentlemen! EOS In the king's name, all of you!”  With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive. EOS The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. EOS He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. EOS They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. EOS The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting. EOS The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. EOS The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. EOS The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation. EOS The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill. EOS “So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. EOS “Yo there! EOS Stand! EOS I shall fire!”  The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”  “Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. EOS “What are you?”  “_Is_ that the Dover mail?”  “Why do you want to know?”  “I want a passenger, if it is.”  “What passenger?”  “Mr. EOS “Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist, “because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime. EOS Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”  “What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. EOS Is it Jerry?”  (“I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to himself. EOS “He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)  “Yes, Mr. Lorry.”  “What is the matter?”  “A despatch sent after you from over yonder. EOS T. and Co.”  “I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. EOS “Hallo you!”  “Well! EOS d'ye mind me? EOS And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. EOS For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. EOS The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man. EOS “Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence. EOS I belong to Tellson's Bank. EOS You must know Tellson's Bank in London. EOS I am going to Paris on business. EOS I may read this?”  “If so be as you're quick, sir.”  He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud: “'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.' EOS It's not long, you see, guard. EOS The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. EOS The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. EOS For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes. EOS “Tom!” softly over the coach roof. EOS After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill. EOS “After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. EOS “'Recalled to life.' EOS That's a Blazing strange message. EOS Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! EOS You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!”     III. EOS The Night Shadows   A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. EOS A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! EOS Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. EOS No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. EOS No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. EOS It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. EOS My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. EOS In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them? EOS As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. EOS So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next. EOS The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. EOS He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. EOS They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. EOS When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again. EOS Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit _your_ line of business! EOS Recalled--! EOS Bust me if I don't think he'd been a drinking!”  His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. EOS Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. EOS It was so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over. EOS While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness. EOS They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road. EOS What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. EOS Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. EOS Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them. EOS But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. EOS He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave. EOS Will you come and see her?”  The answers to this question were various and contradictory. EOS Sometimes the broken reply was, “Wait! EOS It would kill me if I saw her too soon.”  Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, “Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, “I don't know her. EOS Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. EOS Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. EOS The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. EOS “Buried how long?”  “Almost eighteen years.”  “I hope you care to live?”  “I can't say.”  Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave. EOS He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. EOS Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful. EOS “Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. EOS “Gracious Creator of day! EOS To be buried alive for eighteen years!”     IV. EOS The Preparation   When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was. EOS He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon. EOS By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations. EOS Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog. EOS Yes, sir. EOS That way, sir, if you please. EOS Show Concord! EOS Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. EOS Pull off gentleman's boots in Concord. EOS (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) EOS Fetch barber to Concord. EOS Stir about there, now, for Concord!”  The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. EOS The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. EOS Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire. EOS He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. EOS A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. EOS He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. EOS But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on. EOS She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank. EOS Please to let me know.”  “Yes, sir. EOS Tellson's Bank in London, sir?”  “Yes.”  “Yes, sir. EOS We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. EOS A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House.”  “Yes. EOS Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?”  “Not of late years. EOS It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last from France.”  “Indeed, sir? EOS That was before my time here, sir. EOS When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach. EOS The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. EOS It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. EOS The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. EOS When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals. EOS He set down his glass untouched. EOS “This is Mam'selle!” said he. EOS In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's. EOS The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment. EOS It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. EOS The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. EOS The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette. EOS “Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed. EOS “I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that some intelligence--or discovery--”  “The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”  “--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so long dead--”  Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids. EOS As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets! EOS The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”  “I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. EOS It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature. EOS “Yes--I--”  After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”  He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. EOS “Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”  “Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile. EOS Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing. EOS He watched her as she mused, and the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:  “In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”  “If you please, sir.”  “Miss Manette, I am a man of business. EOS I have a business charge to acquit myself of. EOS Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of repute in Paris. EOS I had the honour of knowing him there. EOS Our relations were business relations, but confidential. EOS I was at that time in our French House, and had been--oh! EOS twenty years.”  “At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”  “I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. EOS He married--an English lady--and I was one of the trustees. EOS I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. EOS To go on--”  “But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think”--the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to England. EOS I am almost sure it was you.”  Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. EOS He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his. EOS “Miss Manette, it _was_ I. EOS No; you have been the ward of Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson's House since. EOS Feelings! EOS I have no time for them, no chance of them. EOS I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle.”  After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude. EOS “So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. EOS If your father had not died when he did--Don't be frightened! EOS And she caught his wrist with both her hands. EOS As I was saying--”  Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:  “As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”  “I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”  “I will. EOS I am going to. EOS You can bear it?”  “I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.”  “You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. EOS That's good!” (Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) EOS Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. EOS Now if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born--”  “The little child was a daughter, sir.”  “A daughter. EOS In Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!”  “For the truth. EOS Let us be clear-headed. EOS I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.”  Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry. EOS “That's right, that's right. EOS Courage! EOS Business! EOS Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. EOS And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”  As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey. EOS “You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you. EOS The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror. EOS “But he has been--been found. EOS Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best. EOS It will be his Ghost--not him!”  Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. EOS See now, see now! EOS You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.”  She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”  “Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. EOS It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner. EOS It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous. EOS Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. EOS I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. EOS My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;' which may mean anything. EOS But what is the matter! EOS She doesn't notice a word! EOS Miss Manette!”  Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead. EOS So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving. EOS A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him flying back against the nearest wall. EOS (“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry's breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.) EOS “Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants. EOS I am not so much to look at, am I? EOS Why don't you go and fetch things? EOS I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”  There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care. EOS “And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; “couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? EOS Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. EOS Do you call _that_ being a Banker?”  Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder. EOS “I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “No thanks to you in brown, if she does. EOS V. The Wine-shop   A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. EOS The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell. EOS The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. EOS Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. EOS Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. EOS There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence. EOS There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. EOS When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. EOS The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine. EOS The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. EOS Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD. EOS The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there. EOS And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. EOS Hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. EOS A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. EOS In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. EOS Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. EOS The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. EOS The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. EOS The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together. EOS Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker's stock was murderous. EOS The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. EOS Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. EOS Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest. EOS For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition. EOS But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning. EOS The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. EOS It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too. EOS “What now? EOS Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. EOS “Why do you write in the public streets? EOS Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place to write such words in?”  In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker's heart. EOS The joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out. EOS A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances. EOS His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows. EOS Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair. EOS Good-humoured looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man. EOS Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner. EOS Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings. EOS This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way. EOS The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner. EOS Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine. EOS “Is all the spilt wine swallowed?”  “Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge. EOS “It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death. EOS The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips. EOS “Ah! EOS So much the worse! EOS A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. EOS Am I right, Jacques?”  “You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge. EOS “Hold then! EOS True!” muttered her husband. EOS She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look. EOS Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it. EOS “Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, “good day. EOS The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor. EOS But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way. EOS “Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door. EOS Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. EOS The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. EOS Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing. EOS Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before. EOS It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. EOS In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. EOS It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. EOS He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man. EOS “It is very high; it is a little difficult. EOS Better to begin slowly.”  Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs. EOS “Is he alone?” the latter whispered. EOS “Alone! EOS God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the same low voice. EOS “Is he always alone, then?”  “Yes.”  “Of his own desire?”  “Of his own necessity. EOS As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”  “He is greatly changed?”  “Changed!”  The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse. EOS No direct answer could have been half so forcible. EOS The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. EOS Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. EOS Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations. EOS At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. EOS There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached. EOS The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key. EOS “The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised. EOS “Ay. EOS Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge. EOS “You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”  “I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily. EOS “Why?”  “Why! EOS “Yes. EOS And a beautiful world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day. EOS Long live the Devil. EOS Let us go on.”  This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears. EOS “Courage, dear miss! EOS Courage! EOS Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. EOS That's well, friend Defarge. EOS Come, now. EOS Business, business!”  They went up slowly and softly. EOS The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. EOS On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop. EOS “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”  The three glided by, and went silently down. EOS Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”  With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. EOS Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. EOS With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could. EOS He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. EOS Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking. EOS “A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek. EOS What?”  “I mean of him. EOS Of my father.”  Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. EOS He sat her down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him. EOS Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his hand. EOS All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make. EOS The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction. EOS To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way. EOS The Shoemaker   “Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking. EOS It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:  “Good day!”  “You are still hard at work, I see?”  After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again. EOS It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. EOS Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. EOS It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. EOS So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. EOS So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. EOS Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty. EOS “I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, “to let in a little more light here. EOS You can bear a little more?”  The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker. EOS “What did you say?”  “You can bear a little more light?”  “I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.) EOS The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. EOS A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. EOS His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. EOS He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. EOS The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. EOS His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. EOS He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent. EOS “Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward. EOS I suppose so. EOS I don't know.”  But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again. EOS When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up. EOS The look and the action had occupied but an instant. EOS “What did you say?”  “Here is a visitor.”  The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work. EOS “Come!” said Defarge. EOS “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one. EOS Show him that shoe you are working at. EOS Take it, monsieur.”  Mr. Lorry took it in his hand. EOS “Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.”  There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:  “I forget what it was you asked me. EOS What did you say?”  “I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's information?”  “It is a lady's shoe. EOS I have had a pattern in my hand.” He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride. EOS Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. EOS The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man. EOS “You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him. EOS His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground. EOS “I am not a shoemaker by trade? EOS I-I learnt it here. EOS I taught myself. EOS I asked leave to--”  He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. EOS His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night. EOS “I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”  As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:  “Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”  The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner. EOS “Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; “do you remember nothing of this man? EOS Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?”  As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. EOS They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. EOS Darkness had fallen on him in its place. EOS He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way. EOS Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work. EOS “Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper. EOS “Yes; for a moment. EOS At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well. EOS Let us draw further back. EOS She stood, like a spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work. EOS It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. EOS It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood. EOS He raised them, and saw her face. EOS She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had. EOS He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. EOS By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:  “What is this?”  With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there. EOS “You are not the gaoler's daughter?”  She sighed “No.”  “Who are you?”  Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench beside him. EOS A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her. EOS Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her neck. EOS Advancing his hand by little and little, he took it up and looked at it. EOS Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his shoulder. EOS After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it. EOS “It is the same. EOS When was it! EOS How was it!”  As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too. EOS He turned her full to the light, and looked at her. EOS 'You will leave me them? EOS They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.' EOS Those were the words I said. EOS But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!”  “Hark!” he exclaimed. EOS It died out, as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily shook his head. EOS It can't be. EOS These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. EOS She was--and He was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. EOS What is your name, my gentle angel?”  Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast. EOS “O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. EOS O my dear, my dear!”  His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him. EOS “If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! EOS If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!”  She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child. EOS “If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! EOS And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! EOS Good gentlemen, thank God! EOS I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. EOS Thank God for us, thank God!”  He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces. EOS When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground. EOS Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry. EOS “More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him.”  “It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. EOS Why should you be? EOS In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.”  Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining. EOS But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it. EOS Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. EOS Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet. EOS Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. EOS “You remember the place, my father? EOS You remember coming up here?”  “What did you say?”  But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it. EOS “Remember? EOS No, I don't remember. EOS It was so very long ago.”  That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to them. EOS They heard him mutter, “One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him. EOS On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again. EOS No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. EOS The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. EOS Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. EOS She quickly brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing. EOS They were consigned to me, with him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. EOS “It is well. EOS Forward!” from the uniform. EOS “Adieu!” from Defarge. EOS And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars. EOS Book the Second--the Golden Thread     I. EOS Five Years Later   Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. EOS It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. EOS They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. EOS Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment. EOS Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven--! EOS Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's. EOS Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. EOS If your business necessitated your seeing “the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. EOS Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. EOS Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. EOS But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's. EOS Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's? EOS Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. EOS Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. EOS Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner. EOS When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. EOS They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. EOS Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment. EOS Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house. EOS He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. EOS The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. EOS The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. EOS (Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.) EOS Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one. EOS Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread. EOS Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home. EOS At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. EOS At which juncture, he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:  “Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!”  A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to. EOS “What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. EOS “You're at it agin, are you?”  After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at the woman as a third. EOS It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay. EOS “What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his mark--“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”  “I was only saying my prayers.”  “Saying your prayers! EOS You're a nice woman! EOS What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?”  “I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”  “You weren't. EOS And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. EOS Here! EOS You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son. EOS “And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr. Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of _your_ prayers may be? EOS Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!”  “They only come from the heart, Jerry. EOS They are worth no more than that.”  “Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher. EOS Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. EOS I can't afford it. EOS I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. EOS If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to 'em. EOS If I had had any but a unnat'ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. EOS Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. EOS For, I tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won't be gone agin, in this manner. EOS yes! EOS You're religious, too. EOS You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you? EOS Not you!” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business. EOS He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother. EOS He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity. EOS “Now, Aggerawayter! EOS What are you up to? EOS “I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. EOS I won't have my wittles blest off my table. EOS Keep still!”  Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie. EOS Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day. EOS It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it formed the encampment for the day. EOS Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys. EOS The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street. EOS The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:  “Porter wanted!”  “Hooray, father! EOS Here's an early job to begin with!”  Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated. EOS His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry. EOS “Where does my father get all that iron rust from? EOS A Sight   “You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger. EOS “Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. EOS “I _do_ know the Bailey.”  “Just so. EOS And you know Mr. Lorry.”  “I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. EOS He will then let you in.”  “Into the court, sir?”  “Into the court.”  Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”  “Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that conference. EOS “I am going to tell you. EOS He wishes to have a messenger at hand. EOS This is to tell him you are there.”  As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage, remarked:  “I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?”  “Treason!”  “That's quartering,” said Jerry. EOS “It is the law.”  “It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. EOS It's hard enough to kill him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir.”  “Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. EOS I give you that advice.”  “It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. EOS “I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”  “Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood. EOS Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways. EOS Here is the letter. EOS They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it. EOS For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. EOS So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. EOS It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven. EOS Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong. EOS For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the former entertainment was much the dearer. EOS “What's on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next to. EOS That's the sentence.”  “If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso. EOS Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court. EOS After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again. EOS “What's _he_ got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with. EOS “Blest if I know,” said Jerry. EOS “What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”  “Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry. EOS Presently, the dock became the central point of interest. EOS Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him. EOS Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. EOS Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain. EOS The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye. EOS He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament. EOS The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity. EOS Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his fascination. EOS The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. EOS Silence in the court! EOS This much, Jerry, with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak. EOS The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. EOS He was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn. EOS Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. EOS Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead. EOS Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. EOS Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away. EOS It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. EOS About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them. EOS Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. EOS This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, “Who are they?”  Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. EOS A Disappointment   Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. EOS That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. EOS That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council. EOS That, this patriot would be produced before them. EOS That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime. EOS That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. EOS That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country. EOS That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. EOS That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. EOS That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power. EOS That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. EOS That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans. EOS That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not. EOS That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off. EOS That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone. EOS When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box. EOS Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. EOS Having released his noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr. Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. EOS The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court. EOS Had he ever been a spy himself? EOS No, he scorned the base insinuation. EOS What did he live upon? EOS Where was his property? EOS He didn't precisely remember where it was. EOS No business of anybody's. EOS From whom? EOS Distant relation. EOS Very distant? EOS Rather. EOS Ever been in prison? EOS Certainly not. EOS Never in a debtors' prison? EOS Didn't see what that had to do with it. EOS Never in a debtors' prison?--Come, once again. EOS Never? EOS Gentleman. EOS Ever been kicked? EOS Might have been. EOS No. EOS Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord. EOS Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice? EOS Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true. EOS Positively. EOS Ever live by play? EOS Ever borrow money of the prisoner? EOS Yes. EOS Ever pay him? EOS Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets? EOS No. EOS Knew no more about the lists? EOS No. EOS Had not procured them himself, for instance? EOS No. EOS No. EOS Oh dear no. EOS Swear that? EOS Over and over again. EOS The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a great rate. EOS He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him. EOS In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner's pockets, over and over again. EOS He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk. EOS He had not put them there first. EOS He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. EOS He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one. EOS He didn't call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious. EOS He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him. EOS The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry. EOS Was he one of those two passengers?”  “I cannot undertake to say that he was.”  “Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”  “Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”  “Mr. EOS Except that I remember them both to have been--like myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.”  “Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”  “I certainly have seen that.”  “Mr. EOS Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?”  “I have.”  “When?”  “I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the voyage with me.”  “At what hour did he come on board?”  “At a little after midnight.”  “In the dead of the night. EOS A gentleman and lady. EOS Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”  “Hardly any. EOS The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”  “Miss Manette!”  The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now turned again, stood up where she had sat. EOS Her father rose with her, and kept her hand drawn through his arm. EOS “Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”  To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd. EOS Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him to remain quite still. EOS “Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Where?”  “On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same occasion.”  “You are the young lady just now referred to?”  “O! EOS most unhappily, I am!”  The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions put to you, and make no remark upon them.”  “Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Recall it.”  In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the gentleman came on board--”  “Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows. EOS “Yes, my Lord.”  “Then say the prisoner.”  “When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health. EOS My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him. EOS There were no other passengers that night, but we four. EOS The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. EOS Had he come on board alone?”  “No.”  “How many were with him?”  “Two French gentlemen.”  “Had they conferred together?”  “They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”  “Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?”  “Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what papers.”  “Like these in shape and size?”  “Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that they looked at papers.”  “Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette.”  “The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my father. EOS Please to go on.”  “He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name. EOS Be particular.”  “He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on England's part. EOS He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third. EOS But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time.”  Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators. EOS Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette. EOS Who was called accordingly. EOS “Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. EOS Have you ever seen him before?”  “Once. EOS When he called at my lodgings in London. EOS My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here. EOS The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. EOS Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner. EOS “You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”  The witness was quite sure. EOS How say you? EOS My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable. EOS The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber. EOS Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence. EOS He had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look rather like. EOS How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. EOS How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. EOS How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full. EOS But, there my Lord interposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions. EOS Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse. EOS Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner. EOS And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again. EOS While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. EOS Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike. EOS Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I'd hold half a guinea that _he_ don't get no law-work to do. EOS look to that young lady. EOS Help the gentleman to take her out. EOS It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. EOS They were not agreed, and wished to retire. EOS My Lord (perhaps with George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself. EOS The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted. EOS It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while. EOS The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down. EOS Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him. EOS “Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. EOS But, keep in the way. EOS You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. EOS Don't be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. EOS You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can.”  Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. EOS Mr. Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm. EOS “How is the young lady?”  “She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court.”  “I'll tell the prisoner so. EOS The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes. EOS Darnay!”  The prisoner came forward directly. EOS “You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. EOS She will do very well. EOS I will, if you ask it.”  Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. EOS He stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar. EOS “I do ask it. EOS Accept my cordial thanks.”  “What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you expect, Mr. Darnay?”  “The worst.”  “It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. EOS But I think their withdrawing is in your favour.”  Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them. EOS “Jerry! EOS “Quick! EOS Have you got it?”  “Yes, sir.”  Hastily written on the paper was the word “ACQUITTED.”  “If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again,” muttered Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”  He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion. EOS Congratulatory   From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death. EOS It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. EOS Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. EOS While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away. EOS She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always. EOS Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life. EOS It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account.”  “You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”  said his late client, taking his hand. EOS “Well! EOS you have been present all day, and you ought to know. EOS Speak for yourself.”  “I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”  He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. EOS His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. EOS With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. EOS “My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. EOS “Shall we go home, my father?”  With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”  The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. EOS Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. EOS Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. EOS Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. EOS He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement. EOS “So, Mr. Lorry! EOS We have to think of the House more than ourselves.”  “_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. EOS “Don't be nettled, Mr. Lorry. EOS You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say.”  “And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don't know what you have to do with the matter. EOS “It is a pity you have not, sir.”  “I think so, too.”  “If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”  “Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't,” said Mr. Carton. EOS “Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference, “business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. EOS And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. EOS Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! EOS Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay:  “This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. EOS I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other. EOS Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”  Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. EOS Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him. EOS “Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?”  “I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.”  “It must be an immense satisfaction!”  He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one. EOS It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. EOS So we are not much alike in that particular. EOS “Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don't you call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?”  “What health? EOS What toast?”  “Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. EOS It ought to be, it must be, I'll swear it's there.”  “Miss Manette, then!”  “Miss Manette, then!”  Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another. EOS “That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!”  he said, filling his new goblet. EOS A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer. EOS Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”  Again Darnay answered not a word. EOS Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”  The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. EOS “I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder. EOS “It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. EOS Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”  “Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”  “Do you think I particularly like you?”  “Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have not asked myself the question.”  “But ask yourself the question now.”  “You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.”  “_I_ don't think I do,” said Carton. EOS “I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.”  “Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.”  Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. EOS On his answering in the affirmative, “Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.”  The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. EOS I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”  “Much to be regretted. EOS Don't let your sober face elate you, however; you don't know what it may come to. EOS Good night!”  When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it. EOS “Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? EOS There is nothing in you to like; you know that. EOS Ah, confound you! EOS What a change you have made in yourself! EOS A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! EOS Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? EOS V. The Jackal   Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. EOS So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. EOS The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race. EOS It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments. EOS But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. EOS The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning. EOS Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally. EOS What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship. EOS Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. EOS At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity. EOS Your honour told me to call you.”  “Oh! EOS Very well, very well.”  After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. EOS He turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers. EOS He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. EOS “About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”  They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire. EOS A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons. EOS I have been dining with the day's client; or seeing him dine--it's all one!”  “That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification. EOS How did you come by it? EOS “You and your luck, Sydney! EOS Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”  “Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr. Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers. EOS Fire away!”  The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. EOS From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity. EOS At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. EOS When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. EOS The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning. EOS “And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr. Stryver. EOS The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied. EOS What has roughened your temper? EOS Put some punch to it and smooth it again.”  With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied. EOS “The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the old seesaw Sydney. EOS The same Sydney, with the same luck. EOS Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”  “And why not?”  “God knows. EOS It was my way, I suppose.”  He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire. EOS “Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way is, and always was, a lame way. EOS Look at me.”  “Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, “don't _you_ be moral!”  “How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I do?”  “Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. EOS Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere.”  “And whose fault was that?”  “Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. EOS You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. EOS “Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. EOS If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass. EOS I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. EOS And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city. EOS In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. EOS A moment, and it was gone. EOS Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears. EOS VI. EOS Hundreds of People   The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square. EOS On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor. EOS After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life. EOS On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. EOS Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them. EOS A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. EOS There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. EOS It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets. EOS There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was. EOS In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. EOS Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. EOS Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him. EOS These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon. EOS “Doctor Manette at home?”  Expected home. EOS “Miss Lucie at home?”  Expected home. EOS “Miss Pross at home?”  Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact. EOS Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. EOS The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved? EOS There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another. EOS The first was the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris. EOS “I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!”  “And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start. EOS “Pooh! EOS You'd have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off. EOS “How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice. EOS “I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how are you?”  “Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross. EOS “Indeed?”  “Ah! EOS indeed!” said Miss Pross. EOS “Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. EOS “I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing--since she was ten years old. EOS And it's really very hard,”  said Miss Pross. EOS Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything. EOS “All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. EOS “When you began it--”  “_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”  “Didn't you? EOS Who brought her father to life?”  “Oh! EOS If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry. EOS I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances. EOS But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me.”  Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives. EOS He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's. EOS “There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a mistake in life.”  Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. EOS Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her. EOS “But I don't say he don't refer to it within himself.”  “Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”  “I do,” said Miss Pross. EOS Have no imagination at all.”  “I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?”  “Now and then,” said Miss Pross. EOS “Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?”  “I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”  “And that is--?”  “That she thinks he has.”  “Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”  “Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity. EOS Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no, no. EOS I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? EOS To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid of the whole subject.”  “Afraid?”  “It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. EOS It's a dreadful remembrance. EOS Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. EOS Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again. EOS That alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant, I should think.”  It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. EOS Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him. EOS “Touch that string, and he instantly changes for the worse. EOS Better leave it alone. EOS In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. EOS Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in his old prison. EOS But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him. EOS In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.”  Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing. EOS “Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; “and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”  It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach. EOS Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. EOS Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women. EOS Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried. EOS Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. EOS But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction. EOS Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better. EOS On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. EOS As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her, they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. EOS She had installed herself, some time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. EOS Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads. EOS Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. EOS Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he was only One. EOS But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house. EOS “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of the Tower?”  “Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. EOS Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. EOS They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. EOS At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been. EOS At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. EOS The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. EOS His manner and his look quite terrified them all. EOS There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start. EOS We had better go in.”  He recovered himself almost instantly. EOS Rain was really falling in large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. EOS He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of his business eye. EOS Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. EOS Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two. EOS Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton leaned against a window. EOS The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings. EOS “The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor Manette. EOS “It comes slowly.”  “It comes surely,” said Carton. EOS They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do. EOS There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there. EOS “A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had listened for a while. EOS “Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn--”  “Let us shudder too. EOS We may know what it is.”  “It will seem nothing to you. EOS I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives.”  “There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”  Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way. EOS The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid. EOS The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight. EOS “Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?”  “I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it. EOS “_I_ ask no questions and make no stipulations. EOS There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window. EOS “And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. EOS A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight. EOS The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. EOS There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier. EOS “Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. EOS “Good night, Mr. Darnay. EOS Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”  Perhaps. EOS Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too. EOS VII. EOS Monseigneur in Town   Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. EOS It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. EOS One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. EOS Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two. EOS Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. EOS Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. EOS So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. EOS A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it. EOS Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way--tend to his own power and pocket. EOS Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them. EOS The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”  Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. EOS As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. EOS Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt. EOS A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. EOS Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife. EOS For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. EOS People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant. EOS Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. EOS Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. EOS Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. EOS Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. EOS Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother. EOS Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing known to the fashion. EOS In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong. EOS Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. EOS Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never became manifest. EOS But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. EOS Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. EOS Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off. EOS Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth. EOS There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites, and was seen no more. EOS The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. EOS There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out. EOS The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. EOS In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. EOS They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. EOS Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one. EOS Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. EOS His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. EOS But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could. EOS At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged. EOS But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not? EOS A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal. EOS Is it his child?”  “Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”  The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. EOS As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. EOS “Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. EOS “Dead!”  The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. EOS The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. EOS Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. EOS He took out his purse. EOS “It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. EOS One or the other of you is for ever in the way. EOS How do I know what injury you have done my horses. EOS See! EOS Give him that.”  He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. EOS On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. EOS “I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. EOS “Be a brave man, my Gaspard! EOS It has died in a moment without pain. EOS Could it have lived an hour as happily?”  “You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling. EOS The horses there; are they right?”  Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor. EOS “Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. EOS “Hold the horses! EOS Who threw that?”  He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting. EOS If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.”  So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. EOS Among the men, not one. EOS But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the Marquis in the face. EOS It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”  He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. EOS The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they peeped. EOS The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate. EOS The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course. EOS VIII. EOS Monseigneur in the Country   A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. EOS Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. EOS On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away. EOS A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting sun. EOS The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. EOS “It will die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”  In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. EOS When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off. EOS Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home. EOS The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. EOS It had its poor people too. EOS Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. EOS As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag. EOS Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions' whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. EOS It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him. EOS He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years. EOS Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group. EOS “What man, pig? EOS And why look there?”  “Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.”  “Who?” demanded the traveller. EOS How do you call the man? EOS You know all the men of this part of the country. EOS He was not of this part of the country. EOS Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.”  “Swinging by the chain? EOS To be suffocated?”  “With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. EOS His head hanging over--like this!”  He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow. EOS “What was he like?”  “Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. EOS All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”  The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. EOS Bah! EOS Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!”  Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner. EOS “Bah! EOS “Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”  “Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”  “Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?”  The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. EOS “Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”  “Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river.”  “See to it, Gabelle. EOS The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. EOS At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was dreadfully spare and thin. EOS She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door. EOS “It is you, Monseigneur! EOS Monseigneur, a petition.”  With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out. EOS “How, then! EOS My husband, the forester.”  “What of your husband, the forester? EOS Always the same with you people. EOS He cannot pay something?”  “He has paid all, Monseigneur. EOS Can I restore him to you?”  “Alas, no, Monseigneur! EOS Monseigneur, hear my petition! EOS My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.”  “Again, well? EOS Can I feed them?”  “Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. EOS My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed over him to show where he lies. EOS Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. EOS Monseigneur! EOS The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. EOS The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his chateau was opened to him. EOS “Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”  “Monseigneur, not yet.”     IX. EOS The Gorgon's Head   It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. EOS All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air. EOS Other sound than the owl's voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again. EOS Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. EOS High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. EOS “Ah! EOS It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is. EOS I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”  In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper. EOS “What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour. EOS That?”  “Outside the blinds. EOS Open the blinds.”  It was done. EOS “Well?”  “Monseigneur, it is nothing. EOS The trees and the night are all that are here.”  The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions. EOS “Close them again.”  That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. EOS It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the chateau. EOS “Ask who is arrived.”  It was the nephew of Monseigneur. EOS He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him. EOS In a little while he came. EOS He had been known in England as Charles Darnay. EOS Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands. EOS And you?”  “I come direct.”  “From London?”  “Yes.”  “You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile. EOS I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.”  “I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his answer--“various business.”  “Without doubt,” said the polished uncle. EOS So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. EOS When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation. EOS “I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away. EOS It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.”  “Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”  “I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”  The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring. EOS “Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.”  “No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly. EOS “But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.”  “My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. EOS “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”  “I recall it.”  “Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed. EOS “In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here.”  “I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee. EOS “Dare I ask you to explain?”  “I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”  “It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. EOS “For the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent. EOS Pray excuse me!”  “I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew. EOS “I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined politeness; “I would not be sure of that. EOS A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. EOS These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity. EOS We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. EOS All very bad, very bad!”  The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration. EOS “Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.”  “There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”  “A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur. EOS But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference. EOS The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts out the sky.”  That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. EOS As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets. EOS “Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not. EOS But you must be fatigued. EOS Even in my father's time, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure, whatever it was. EOS “And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”  “Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”  Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. EOS Once again he touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,  “My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived.”  When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket. EOS But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.”  “This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I renounce them.”  “Are they both yours to renounce? EOS It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”  “I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. EOS If it passed to me from you, to-morrow--”  “Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”  “--or twenty years hence--”  “You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that supposition.”  “--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. EOS What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”  “Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room. EOS “If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. EOS There is a curse on it, and on all this land.”  “And you?” said the uncle. EOS The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. EOS It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. EOS “England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile. EOS “I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir. EOS You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? EOS “You are fatigued. EOS Good night!”  As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. EOS At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic. EOS “Yes,” repeated the Marquis. EOS Yes. EOS So commences the new philosophy! EOS You are fatigued. EOS Good night!”  It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. EOS Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on. EOS He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage. EOS The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets. EOS For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. EOS The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. EOS Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed. EOS The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark hours. EOS Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened. EOS Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. EOS In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. EOS The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. EOS At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken. EOS Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. EOS Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. EOS Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. EOS Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. EOS In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot. EOS The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely. EOS First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed. EOS All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning. EOS Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away? EOS What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at, on a heap of stones? EOS The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. EOS Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. EOS It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau. EOS The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years. EOS It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. EOS Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. EOS This, from Jacques.”     X. EOS Two Promises   More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature. EOS He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. EOS He could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English. EOS He was well acquainted, more-over, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. EOS So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered. EOS In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he would not have prospered. EOS In this, his prosperity consisted. EOS A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house. EOS The rest of his time he passed in London. EOS Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a woman. EOS He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. EOS He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him. EOS But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart. EOS That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. EOS It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. EOS It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. EOS The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. EOS In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare. EOS He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful. EOS To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. EOS I rejoice to see you. EOS We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. EOS Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”  “I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. EOS “Miss Manette--”  “Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will delight us all. EOS She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.”  “Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. EOS I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.”  There was a blank silence. EOS “Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint. EOS “I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,”  so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--”  He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. EOS When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:  “Is Lucie the topic?”  “She is.”  “It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. EOS It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”  “It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!” he said deferentially. EOS There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:  “I believe it. EOS “Shall I go on, sir?”  Another blank. EOS “Yes, go on.”  “You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. EOS Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. EOS If ever there were love in the world, I love her. EOS You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”  The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. EOS At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried:  “Not that, sir! EOS Let that be! EOS I adjure you, do not recall that!”  His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. EOS He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. EOS “I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. EOS “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.”  He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. EOS His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face:  “Have you spoken to Lucie?”  “No.”  “Nor written?”  “Never.”  “It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. EOS Her father thanks you.”  He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. EOS “I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child. EOS I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. EOS I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. EOS I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. EOS I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. EOS I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. EOS His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation. EOS “Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. EOS Heaven is my witness that I love her!”  “I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. EOS “I have thought so before now. EOS If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand.”  He laid his own upon it as he spoke. EOS “No, dear Doctor Manette. EOS Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. EOS A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread. EOS “You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. EOS Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”  “None. EOS As yet, none.”  “Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?”  “Not even so. EOS But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”  “Do you seek any promise from me?”  “I do seek that.”  “What is it?”  “I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. EOS I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”  “If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”  “I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. EOS Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate. EOS My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.”  “May I ask, sir, if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest. EOS “Is sought by any other suitor?”  “It is what I meant to say.”  Her father considered a little before he answered:  “You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. EOS Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. EOS If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”  “Or both,” said Darnay. EOS “I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. EOS You want a promise from me. EOS I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. EOS I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. EOS I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. EOS I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self. EOS If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--”  The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke:  “--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake. EOS This is idle talk.”  So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it. EOS “What was it you said to me?”  He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. EOS Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:  “Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. EOS My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. EOS I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.”  “Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais. EOS “Tell me when I ask you, not now. EOS Do you promise?”  “Willingly. EOS She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night. EOS God bless you!”  It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty. EOS “Father dear!”  Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom. EOS Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all chilled, “What shall I do! EOS What shall I do!”  Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him. EOS She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. EOS A Companion Picture   “Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”  Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation. EOS The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again. EOS It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours. EOS I intend to marry.”  “_Do_ you?”  “Yes. EOS And not for money. EOS What do you say now?”  “I don't feel disposed to say much. EOS Who is she?”  “Guess.”  “Do I know her?”  “Guess.”  “I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in the morning, with my brains frying and sputtering in my head. EOS If you want me to guess, you must ask me to dinner.”  “Well then, I'll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting posture. EOS I mean I am a man of more--more--”  “Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton. EOS “Well! EOS I'll say gallantry. EOS My meaning is that I am a man,” said Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do.”  “Go on,” said Sydney Carton. EOS You've been at Doctor Manette's house as much as I have, or more than I have. EOS Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!”  “It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much obliged to me.”  “You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. EOS You are a disagreeable fellow.”  Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed. EOS “Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances. EOS Why do I do it?”  “I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton. EOS “I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. EOS And look at me! EOS I get on.”  “You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”  answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that. EOS “You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend's answer, delivered in no very soothing tone. EOS “Who is the lady?”  “Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know you don't mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. EOS I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.”  “I did?”  “Certainly; and in these chambers.”  Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend. EOS If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not. EOS “Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver. EOS “I don't care about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. EOS She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune. EOS Are you astonished?”  Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be astonished?”  “You approve?”  Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”  “Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. EOS Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit. EOS So I have made up my mind. EOS I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way. EOS Marry. EOS Provide somebody to take care of you. EOS That's the kind of thing for _you_. EOS Now think of it, Sydney.”  “I'll think of it,” said Sydney. EOS XII. EOS The Fellow of Delicacy   Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. EOS Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. EOS Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind. EOS Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it. EOS Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was. EOS His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr. Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon. EOS So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum. EOS “How do you do? EOS I hope you are well!”  It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place, or space. EOS He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall. EOS The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat. EOS How do you do, sir?” and shook hands. EOS “Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.”  “Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. EOS “I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”  “Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. EOS “Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back. EOS “Oh dear you, sir? EOS Yes. EOS “Oh! EOS if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “Well! EOS I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry. EOS “Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk. EOS “Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you.”  “Why?” said Stryver. EOS “You are a man of business and bound to have a reason. EOS State your reason. EOS Why wouldn't you go?”  “Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”  “D--n _me_!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”  Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver. EOS “Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_ a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says there's no reason at all! EOS Says it with his head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off. EOS The young lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, “the young lady. EOS The young lady goes before all.”  “Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?”  “Not exactly so. EOS “That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?”  “Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”  “Yes, I do.”  “Very good. EOS Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”  “And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.”  “Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. EOS “As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. EOS The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. EOS I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. EOS It's new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”  “What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.”  “There! EOS I beg your pardon!” said Stryver. EOS Thank you. EOS You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family. EOS If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. EOS What do you say?”  “How long would you keep me in town?”  “Oh! EOS It is only a question of a few hours. EOS I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”  “Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night. EOS Good morning.”  Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks. EOS The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty. EOS “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”  It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found great relief. EOS “Oh, to be sure! EOS What am I thinking of!”  “And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the conversation we had. EOS I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it.”  “I don't understand you,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; “no matter, no matter.”  “But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged. EOS “No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. EOS Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done. EOS In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. EOS There is no harm at all done. EOS I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. EOS And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.”  Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. EOS “Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”  Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. EOS Mr. Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling. EOS XIII. EOS The Fellow of No Delicacy   If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette. EOS He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. EOS When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him. EOS On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod those stones. EOS He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. EOS But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. EOS I shall sink lower, and be worse.”  He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. EOS The table trembled in the silence that followed. EOS She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. EOS Will you hear me?”  “If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!”  “God bless you for your sweet compassion!”  He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily. EOS “Don't be afraid to hear me. EOS Don't shrink from anything I say. EOS All my life might have been.”  “No, Mr. Carton. EOS I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”  “Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget it!”  She was pale and trembling. EOS Can I in no way repay your confidence? EOS I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to no one else. EOS Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”  He shook his head. EOS “To none. EOS No, Miss Manette, to none. EOS I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. EOS Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. EOS I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. EOS A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”  “Will nothing of it remain? EOS O Mr. Carton, think again! EOS Try again!”  “No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving. EOS And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.”  “Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me--”  “Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could. EOS Have I no power for good, with you, at all?”  “The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise. EOS Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.”  “Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”  “Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. EOS I have proved myself, and I know better. EOS Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?”  “If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”  “Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”  “Mr. EOS I will never refer to it again. EOS If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. EOS In the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in your heart. EOS “Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. EOS Be comforted! EOS But, within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. EOS For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. EOS If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. EOS Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. EOS The Honest Tradesman   To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented. EOS Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down! EOS With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry. EOS Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. EOS Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health. EOS And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed. EOS Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him. EOS It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his attention. EOS Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar. EOS The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance. EOS “What d'ye mean? EOS This boy is a getting too many for _me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. EOS “Him and his hooroars! EOS D'ye hear?”  “I warn't doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek. EOS “Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won't have none of _your_ no harms. EOS Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”  His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. EOS Tst! EOS Yaha! EOS Spies!”  with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat. EOS Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellson's. EOS Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:  “What is it, brother? EOS “Spies! EOS Yaha! EOS Tst! EOS Spies!”  He asked another man. EOS “Who is it?”  “_I_ don't know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, “Spies! EOS Yaha! EOS Tst, tst! EOS Spi--ies!”  At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly. EOS “Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher. EOS “Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. EOS “Yaha! EOS Tst! EOS Old Bailey Spi--i--ies!”  “Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted. EOS Dead, is he?”  “Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can't be too dead. EOS Have 'em out, there! EOS Spies!”  The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop. EOS These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded. EOS Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. EOS Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning coach. EOS A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked. EOS Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. EOS It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction. EOS The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. EOS Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. EOS “Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way, “you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he was a young 'un and a straight made 'un.”  Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his station at Tellson's. EOS Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back. EOS Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence. EOS The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea. EOS “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”  The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head. EOS “Why, you're at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension. EOS “I am saying nothing.”  “Well, then; don't meditate nothing. EOS You might as well flop as meditate. EOS Drop it altogether.”  “Yes, Jerry.”  “Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. EOS “Ah! EOS It _is_ yes, Jerry. EOS That's about it. EOS “You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. EOS “Ah! EOS I think so. EOS I believe you.”  “You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took another bite. EOS “Yes, I am.”  “May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly. EOS “No, you mayn't. EOS I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. EOS That's where I'm going to. EOS Going a fishing.”  “Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?”  “Never you mind.”  “Shall you bring any fish home, father?”  “If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that gentleman, shaking his head; “that's questions enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed.”  He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage. EOS The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. EOS It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story. EOS “And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. EOS “No games to-morrow! EOS If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water. EOS I don't know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. EOS Look at your boy: he _is_ your'n, ain't he? EOS He's as thin as a lath. EOS Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?”  This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent. EOS Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them. EOS Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o'clock. EOS Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out. EOS Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father. EOS Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets. EOS Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view. EOS Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two. EOS In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side. EOS They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little--listening perhaps. EOS Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass! EOS They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. EOS Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. EOS Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father's. EOS But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. EOS There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight. EOS He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. EOS It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings. EOS It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. EOS Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed. EOS “I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”  “Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored. EOS “Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? EOS Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business? EOS A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. EOS You have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”  The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his length on the floor. EOS After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay down too, and fell asleep again. EOS There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. EOS He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling. EOS His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. EOS “Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: “what's a Resurrection-Man?”  Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How should I know?”  “I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy. EOS Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, “he's a tradesman.”  “What's his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry. EOS “I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher. EOS “Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!”  Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. EOS “It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. EOS Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”     XV. EOS Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. EOS A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. EOS There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. EOS These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks. EOS Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. EOS He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come. EOS Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off. EOS Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. EOS All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. EOS Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them. EOS “Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge. EOS It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. EOS It elicited an answering chorus of “Good day!”  “It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head. EOS Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. EOS “My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. EOS I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris. EOS He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. EOS Give him to drink, my wife!”  A second man got up and went out. EOS Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. EOS In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter. EOS Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. EOS He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work. EOS “Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season. EOS “Yes, thank you.”  “Come, then! EOS You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. EOS It will suit you to a marvel.”  Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes. EOS No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. EOS And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. EOS Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:  “Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! EOS This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. EOS He will tell you all. EOS I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.”  Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year. EOS Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? EOS Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then? EOS “By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. EOS “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' EOS “But what did I know? EOS The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. EOS Observe! EOS Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. EOS Bring that rascal!' EOS My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”  “He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. EOS Nine, ten, eleven?”  “No matter, the number,” said Defarge. EOS “He is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found. EOS Go on!”  “I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed. EOS I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers. EOS In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”  With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him. EOS Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. EOS Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”  He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life. EOS “I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes. EOS says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, 'bring him fast to his tomb!' EOS and they bring him faster. EOS I follow. EOS Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”  He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets. EOS They laugh and pick him up again. EOS His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. EOS In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work. EOS There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. EOS He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man.”  Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. EOS The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too. EOS They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him. EOS “He remains up there in his iron cage some days. EOS But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison. EOS Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. EOS What do I know? EOS It is possible. EOS Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”  “Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed. EOS “Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. EOS All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. EOS You hear?”  “I hear, messieurs.”  “Go on then,” said Defarge. EOS “Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. EOS They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide. EOS One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. EOS That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. EOS But how do I know if he lies? EOS I am not a scholar.”  “Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. EOS “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! EOS And it was done--why, how old are you?”  “Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty. EOS “It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it.”  “Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. EOS Go on.”  “Well! EOS Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. EOS “All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest. EOS At midday, the roll of drums. EOS Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers. EOS He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears. EOS He is hanged there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”  They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle. EOS “It is frightful, messieurs. EOS Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! EOS Under it, have I said? EOS I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade. EOS And here you see me!”  After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! EOS You have acted and recounted faithfully. EOS Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned. EOS The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to the garret. EOS “How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. EOS “Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving. EOS “The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first. EOS “The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. EOS “Extermination.”  The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began gnawing another finger. EOS “Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? EOS Knitted, in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. EOS Confide in Madame Defarge. EOS It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”  There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? EOS I hope so. EOS He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”  “He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. EOS I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road. EOS “Is it a good sign, that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”  “Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her to thirst for it. EOS He needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep. EOS But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. EOS For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out. EOS Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles. EOS It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen. EOS “You work hard, madame,” said a man near her. EOS “Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”  “What do you make, madame?”  “Many things.”  “For instance--”  “For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”  The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive. EOS If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything! EOS as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time. EOS Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! EOS During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces. EOS “Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; “you are a good boy!”  The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no. EOS Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”  “Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that's true.”  “These fools know nothing. EOS Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much.”  Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation. EOS “As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise. EOS Say! EOS Would you not?”  “Truly, madame, I think so. EOS For the moment.”  “If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest. EOS Say! EOS Would you not?”  “Truly yes, madame.”  “Yes. EOS And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”  “It is true, madame.”  “You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; “now, go home!”     XVI. EOS Still Knitting   Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees. EOS Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered. EOS In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there. EOS Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. EOS So does a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star. EOS And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it. EOS The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended. EOS There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry. EOS Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police. EOS There is another spy commissioned for our quarter. EOS How do they call that man?”  “He is English.”  “So much the better. EOS But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness. EOS “Barsad,” repeated madame. EOS Christian name?”  “John.”  “John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. EOS His appearance; is it known?”  “Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.”  “Eh my faith. EOS It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. EOS “He shall be registered to-morrow.”  They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed. EOS The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. EOS Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. EOS He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe. EOS “You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the money. EOS “You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him. EOS “But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! EOS You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!”  “Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, “it _is_ a long time.”  “It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time? EOS “How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store the lightning? EOS Tell me.”  Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too. EOS “It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to swallow a town. EOS Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?”  “A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge. EOS “But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it. EOS In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen or heard. EOS That is your consolation. EOS Keep it.”  She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe. EOS “I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, “that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. EOS I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. EOS Can such things last? EOS I mock you.”  “My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. EOS How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled. EOS “We shall not see the triumph.”  “We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in strong action. EOS “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. EOS But even if not, even if I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I would--”  Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed. EOS “Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”  “Yes! EOS Sustain yourself without that. EOS When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”  Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed. EOS Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. EOS The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom. EOS She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure. EOS Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression! EOS Good day, one and all!”  “Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”  Madame complied with a polite air. EOS “Marvellous cognac this, madame!”  It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. EOS “You knit with great skill, madame.”  “I am accustomed to it.”  “A pretty pattern too!”  “_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile. EOS “Decidedly. EOS May one ask what it is for?”  “Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. EOS “Not for use?”  “That depends. EOS I may find a use for it one day. EOS If I do--Well,” said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, “I'll use it!”  It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. EOS They had all dropped off. EOS The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. EOS So oppressed, too--as you say.”  “As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good. EOS “Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. EOS Of course.”  “_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice. EOS “I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. EOS All we think, here, is how to live. EOS That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. EOS No, no.”  The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac. EOS Ah! EOS “My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. EOS He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”  “I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? EOS Between ourselves.”  “Is there?” asked madame, vacantly. EOS “Is there not?”  “--Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge. EOS “Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare. EOS “You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop. EOS “You mistake me for another. EOS That is not my name. EOS I am Ernest Defarge.”  “It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good day!”  “Good day!” answered Defarge, drily. EOS The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac. EOS Madame Defarge poured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it. EOS “Not at all, but I hope to know it better. EOS “The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,”  pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name.”  “Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference. EOS “Yes, indeed. EOS When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know. EOS He was delivered to you. EOS You see I am informed of the circumstances?”  “Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. EOS He had had it conveyed to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity. EOS “It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of Tellson and Company--over to England.”  “Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge. EOS “I have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England.”  “Yes?” said Defarge. EOS “In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, “we never hear about them. EOS We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held no correspondence.”  “Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. EOS “She is going to be married.”  “Going?” echoed madame. EOS “She was pretty enough to have been married long ago. EOS You know I am English.”  “I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.”  He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. EOS And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! EOS It was cruel, cruel! EOS D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family.”  Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband. EOS Do what he would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. EOS Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. EOS For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back. EOS “Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has said of Ma'amselle Manette?”  “As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it is probably false. EOS But it may be true.”  “If it is--” Defarge began, and stopped. EOS “If it is?” repeated his wife. EOS “--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”  “Her husband's destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, “will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is to end him. EOS That is all I know.”  “But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange”--said Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, “that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?”  “Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” answered madame. EOS “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here for their merits; that is enough.”  She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head. EOS Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect. EOS In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. EOS All the women knitted. EOS They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched. EOS And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left behind. EOS Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. EOS “A great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!”  Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as the women sat knitting, knitting. EOS So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting, counting dropping heads. EOS XVII. EOS One Night   Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together. EOS Lucie was to be married to-morrow. EOS When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him. EOS “And I am very happy to-night, dear father. EOS I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love for me. EOS Even as it is--”  Even as it was, she could not command her voice. EOS In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face upon his breast. EOS “Dearest dear! EOS In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?”  Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling! EOS Indeed it is so. EOS You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--”  She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word. EOS “--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake. EOS Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”  It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering. EOS It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards. EOS “I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her light. EOS I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls. EOS I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way, I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”  The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time, deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference. EOS He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over. EOS “I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent. EOS Whether it was alive. EOS Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father. EOS Whether it was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own will and act. EOS Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.”  She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand. EOS “I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. EOS I have cast up the years of her age, year after year. EOS I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. EOS I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank.”  “My father! EOS It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?”  “She knew nothing of you. EOS She cared nothing for you.”  “So! EOS But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. EOS But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?”  “The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?”  “No. EOS That was another thing. EOS It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved. EOS Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother. EOS The other had that likeness too--as you have--but was not the same. EOS I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions.”  His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition. EOS Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”  “I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was I.”  “And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais, “and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. EOS She could never deliver me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things. EOS But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and blessed her.”  “I am that child, I hope, my father. EOS O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?”  “Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness. EOS My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”  He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. EOS By-and-bye, they went into the house. EOS There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. EOS They were only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. EOS He regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately. EOS So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated. EOS But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears, beforehand. EOS All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet. EOS Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep. EOS A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night. EOS Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once more, and went away. EOS So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him. EOS XVIII. EOS Nine Days   The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. EOS They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom. EOS “And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby! EOS Well; but don't cry,” said the gentle Mr. Lorry. EOS Such a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes. EOS Dear me! EOS This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost. EOS Dear, dear, dear! EOS To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”  “Not at all!” From Miss Pross. EOS “You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?” asked the gentleman of that name. EOS “Pooh!” rejoined Miss Pross; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”  “Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that seems probable, too.”  “And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before you were put in your cradle.”  “Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern. EOS Enough! EOS Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. EOS And when, at the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. EOS Now, I hear Somebody's step coming to the door. EOS Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own.”  For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam. EOS He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. EOS The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married. EOS Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. EOS They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting. EOS But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! EOS She is yours!”  And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone. EOS The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. EOS It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow. EOS But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride. EOS I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently. EOS Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.”  It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's. EOS He was detained two hours. EOS When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking. EOS “O me, O me! EOS All is lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. EOS “What is to be told to Ladybird? EOS He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!”  Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. EOS “Doctor Manette. EOS My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”  The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again. EOS He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. EOS He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. EOS He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was. EOS “A young lady's walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. EOS “It ought to have been finished long ago. EOS Look at me!”  He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work. EOS “You know me, my dear friend? EOS Think, dear friend!”  Nothing would induce him to speak more. EOS He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. EOS Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. EOS In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest. EOS In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post. EOS If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctor's case. EOS He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room. EOS He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. EOS He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling. EOS He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place. EOS Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write. EOS When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him:  “Will you go out?”  He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:  “Out?”  “Yes; for a walk with me. EOS Why not?”  He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. EOS He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep. EOS In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work. EOS He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. EOS This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. EOS This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him. EOS When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:  “Dear Doctor, will you go out?”  As before, he repeated, “Out?”  “Yes; for a walk with me. EOS Why not?”  This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. EOS In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he slipped away to his bench. EOS The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. EOS Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days. EOS With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. EOS XIX. EOS An Opinion   Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. EOS He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep. EOS He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive. EOS Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened? EOS It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. EOS How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning? EOS If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. EOS He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. EOS Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care. EOS Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. EOS An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. EOS In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. EOS And that aid was his own. EOS Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:  “My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.”  Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. EOS He had already glanced at his hands more than once. EOS “Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. EOS Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all, for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.”  “If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental shock--?”  “Yes!”  “Be explicit,” said the Doctor. EOS “Spare no detail.”  Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded. EOS “My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind. EOS The mind. EOS It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. EOS It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. EOS It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large. EOS It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her. EOS “Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. EOS I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding. EOS Tell me, how does this relapse come about? EOS Is there danger of another? EOS How should a repetition of it be treated? EOS How does it come about at all? EOS If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. EOS Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful.”  Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him. EOS “You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”  “Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him?”  “I think so. EOS I even believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”  “Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again, after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this attack?”  “I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady. EOS Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. EOS The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”  “Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry. EOS That's good comfort. EOS “I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence. EOS “There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to be instructed. EOS Now, does he do too much?”  “I think not. EOS That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction. EOS Assuming for a moment, that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?”  “I do not think so. EOS After what has happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again. EOS I trust, and I almost believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”  He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress. EOS He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was, and approached his second and last point. EOS He felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days, he knew that he must face it. EOS “The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. EOS We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge. EOS We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. EOS Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?”  The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot nervously on the ground. EOS “He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at his friend. EOS “Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?”  Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the ground. EOS “You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “I quite understand it to be a nice question. EOS And yet I think--” And there he shook his head, and stopped. EOS “You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause, “it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man's mind. EOS Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”  He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's face. EOS “But may not--mind! EOS I ask for information, as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea? EOS If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go with it? EOS In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the forge?”  There was another silence. EOS “You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old companion.”  “I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. EOS I only want your authority. EOS Come! EOS Give me your authority, like a dear good man. EOS But, I would not take it away while he was present. EOS Let it be removed when he is not there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.”  Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. EOS The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. EOS So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime. EOS XX. EOS A Plea   When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. EOS They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself. EOS He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay. EOS He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard. EOS Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”  Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and good-fellowship, what he did mean? EOS However, let me try. EOS You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than usual?”  “I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.”  “I remember it too. EOS I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me! EOS Don't be alarmed; I am not going to preach.”  “I am not at all alarmed. EOS But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to me, as you represent it to be to you. EOS I have by no means forgotten it, and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”  “If it was a light answer,” returned Darnay, “I beg your forgiveness for it. EOS I declare to you, on the faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. EOS Have I had nothing more important to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”  “As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! EOS I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”  “You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not quarrel with _your_ light answer.”  “Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! EOS I have gone aside from my purpose; I was speaking about our being friends. EOS Now, you know me; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. EOS If you doubt it, ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so.”  “I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”  “Well! EOS '”  “But I do, and you must take my word for it. EOS If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. EOS It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year. EOS It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it.”  “Will you try?”  “That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated. EOS I thank you, Darnay. EOS When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness. EOS He spoke of him, in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself. EOS “We are thoughtful to-night!” said Darnay, drawing his arm about her. EOS “Yes, dearest Charles,” with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; “we are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.”  “What is it, my Lucie?”  “Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?”  “Will I promise? EOS What will I not promise to my Love?”  What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him! EOS “I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night.”  “Indeed, my own? EOS Why so?”  “That is what you are not to ask me. EOS But I think--I know--he does.”  “If you know it, it is enough. EOS I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. EOS My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”  “It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong. EOS I never thought this of him.”  “My husband, it is so. EOS “And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”  The supplication touched him home. EOS “I will always remember it, dear Heart! EOS Echoing Footsteps   A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. EOS Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years. EOS At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed. EOS That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. EOS Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words. EOS Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. EOS They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her. EOS Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. EOS Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden! EOS Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. EOS They see my Father's face. EOS Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. EOS Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. EOS The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. EOS Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. EOS He never came there heated with wine. EOS And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages. EOS Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew. EOS The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last. EOS “Poor Carton! EOS Kiss him for me!”  Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in his wake, like a boat towed astern. EOS Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads. EOS These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to Lucie's husband: delicately saying “Halloa! EOS These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little daughter was six years old. EOS Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her. EOS Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?”  But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time. EOS And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising. EOS On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. EOS It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. EOS “I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. EOS There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! EOS Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. EOS There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.”  “That has a bad look,” said Darnay--  “A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? EOS Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it. EOS Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.”  “Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”  “I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. EOS Where is Manette?”  “Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment. EOS “I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason. EOS You are not going out, I hope?”  “No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said the Doctor. EOS “I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. EOS I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night. EOS The precious child is safe in bed?”  “And sleeping soundly.”  “That's right; all safe and well! EOS I don't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out all day, and I am not as young as I was! EOS Thank ye. EOS Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear the echoes about which you have your theory.”  “Not a theory; it was a fancy.”  “A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. EOS Only hear them!”  Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in the dark London window. EOS A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off. EOS As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar. EOS “Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can. EOS Where is my wife?”  “Eh, well! EOS “Where do you go, my wife?”  “I go,” said madame, “with you at present. EOS “Patriots and friends, we are ready! EOS The Bastille!”  With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. EOS Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began. EOS Through the fire and through the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours. EOS “What! EOS We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!” And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge. EOS Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. EOS Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours. EOS A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered! EOS So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille. EOS There, against an angle of a wall, he made a struggle to look about him. EOS Jacques Three was nearly at his side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. EOS Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show. EOS “The Prisoners!”  “The Records!”  “The secret cells!”  “The instruments of torture!”  “The Prisoners!”  Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, “The Prisoners!” was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. EOS When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall. EOS “Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge. EOS But there is no one there.”  “What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?” asked Defarge. EOS Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?”  “Kill him!” croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up. EOS “Monsieur, it is a cell.”  “Show it me!”  “Pass this way, then.”  Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's. EOS Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. EOS Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing. EOS The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed in:  “One hundred and five, North Tower!”  There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. EOS There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within. EOS There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth. EOS There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them. EOS “Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said Defarge to the turnkey. EOS The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes. EOS “Stop!--Look here, Jacques!”  “A. EOS M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily. EOS What is that in your hand? EOS Give it me!”  He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. EOS He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows. EOS “Look among those fragments with care, Jacques. EOS “Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?”  “Nothing.”  “Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. EOS So! EOS They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. EOS Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be unavenged. EOS The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. EOS Saint Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. EOS “Lower the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!” The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on. EOS The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown. EOS Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits. EOS Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. EOS For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red. EOS The Sea Still Rises   Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. EOS Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. EOS Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. EOS In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. EOS The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike. EOS The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear. EOS There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression. EOS Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. EOS The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance. EOS “Hark!” said The Vengeance. EOS Who comes?”  As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along. EOS “It is Defarge,” said madame. EOS “Silence, patriots!”  Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him! EOS “Listen to him!”  Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet. EOS “The other world?”  “Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?”  “Everybody!” from all throats. EOS “The news is of him. EOS He is among us!”  “Among us!” from the universal throat again. EOS “And dead?”  “Not dead! EOS He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. EOS I have said that he had reason to fear us. EOS A moment of profound silence followed. EOS “Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”  Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women. EOS The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. EOS Villain Foulon taken, my sister! EOS Old Foulon taken, my mother! EOS Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! EOS Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! EOS Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! EOS Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want! EOS O mother of God, this Foulon! EOS O Heaven our suffering! EOS Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! EOS Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him! EOS Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! EOS Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! EOS “See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. EOS “See the old villain bound with ropes. EOS That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back. EOS Let him eat it now!” Madame put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play. EOS Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building. EOS At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. EOS Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors. EOS Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread. EOS Yet, human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them. EOS Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped. EOS The Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoine's bosom. EOS The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered. EOS Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation. EOS Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. EOS Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn out. EOS There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! EOS But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it. EOS For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. EOS No. EOS For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence. EOS As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods. EOS Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail. EOS When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible:  “How goes it, Jacques?”  “All well, Jacques.”  “Touch then!”  They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones. EOS “No dinner?”  “Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry face. EOS “It is the fashion,” growled the man. EOS “I meet no dinner anywhere.”  He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke. EOS “Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. EOS “To-night?” said the mender of roads. EOS “Show me!” said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill. EOS “See!” returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. EOS “_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains. EOS About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.”  “Good. EOS When do you cease to work?”  “At sunset.”  “Will you wake me, before departing? EOS I have walked two nights without resting. EOS Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. EOS He was fast asleep directly. EOS The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. EOS Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips. EOS Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure. EOS And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France. EOS The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. EOS Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him. EOS “Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?”  “About.”  “About. EOS Good!”  The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. EOS Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye. EOS The night deepened. EOS The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. EOS Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. EOS Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous. EOS Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were. EOS A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. EOS “Help, Gabelle! EOS Help, every one!” The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. EOS The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag. EOS At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. EOS Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, “It must burn.”  As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating. EOS The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. EOS With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. EOS When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire. EOS The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. EOS Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. EOS The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy. EOS Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. EOS Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. EOS But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while. EOS Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn. EOS The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully. EOS XXIV. EOS Drawn to the Loadstone Rock   In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. EOS Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home. EOS Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet. EOS For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in. EOS Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together. EOS The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets. EOS It had never been a good eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride, Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped out and was gone. EOS The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together. EOS Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and “suspended,” when the last tidings came over. EOS The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide. EOS Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest. EOS Again: Tellson's was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. EOS Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. EOS For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read. EOS The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. EOS “But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to you--”  “I understand. EOS That I am too old?” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”  “My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. EOS It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. EOS As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence. EOS As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all these years, who ought to be?”  “I wish I were going myself,” said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud. EOS You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry. EOS “You wish you were going yourself? EOS And you a Frenchman born? EOS You are a wise counsellor.”  “My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through my mind often. EOS One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,” he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. EOS Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--”  “When you were talking to Lucie,” Mr. Lorry repeated. EOS “Yes. EOS I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! EOS “It is more to the purpose that you say you are.”  “And I am, in plain reality. EOS The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. EOS Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. EOS Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!”  “How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.”  “Tut! EOS Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. EOS At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”  “And do you really go to-night?”  “I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.”  “And do you take no one with you?”  “All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. EOS I intend to take Jerry. EOS Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him. EOS Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.”  “I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.”  “I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! EOS Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”  This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. EOS It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. EOS Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. EOS And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. EOS Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. EOS The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. EOS The address, turned into English, ran:  “Very pressing. EOS To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. EOS Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.”  On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them. EOS “No,” said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; “I have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.”  The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. EOS “Happy to say, I never knew him.”  “A craven who abandoned his post,” said another--this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of hay--“some years ago.”  “Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the ruffian herd. EOS They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”  “Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver. EOS “Did he though? EOS Is that the sort of fellow? EOS Let us look at his infamous name. EOS D--n the fellow!”  Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said:  “I know the fellow.”  “Do you, by Jupiter?” said Stryver. EOS “I am sorry for it.”  “Why?”  “Why, Mr. Darnay? EOS D'ye hear what he did? EOS Don't ask, why, in these times.”  “But I do ask why?”  “Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. EOS I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. EOS I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. EOS That's why.”  Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”  “I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully Stryver, “and I'll do it. EOS If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_ understand him. EOS You may tell him so, with my compliments. EOS No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”  With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his hearers. EOS Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank. EOS “You know where to deliver it?”  “I do.”  “Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?”  “I will do so. EOS Do you start for Paris from here?”  “From here, at eight.”  “I will come back, to see you off.”  Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. EOS These were its contents:   “Prison of the Abbaye, Paris. EOS “After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. EOS On the road I have suffered a great deal. EOS Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground. EOS It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process. EOS The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant? EOS “Ah! EOS most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant? EOS I cry in my sleep where is he? EOS I demand of Heaven, will he not come to deliver me? EOS No answer. EOS Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris! EOS “For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me. EOS My fault is, that I have been true to you. EOS Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me! EOS “Your afflicted,  “Gabelle.”   The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter. EOS The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby. EOS He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly. EOS He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had never been done. EOS The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. EOS But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread. EOS This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris. EOS Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. EOS Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. EOS Upon those, had followed Gabelle's letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name. EOS His resolution was made. EOS Yes. EOS The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it. EOS Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt. EOS How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. EOS But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course. EOS As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. EOS A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. EOS “I have delivered that letter,” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. EOS “I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?”  “That I will, and readily,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it is not dangerous.”  “Not at all. EOS And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?”  “Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come. EOS “My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I come back.”  Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away. EOS That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances. EOS To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival. EOS It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. EOS It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. EOS But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly. EOS Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart. EOS He left his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey. EOS “For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!” was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the Loadstone Rock. EOS The end of the second book. EOS Book the Third--the Track of a Storm     I. EOS In Secret   The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. EOS More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. EOS Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death. EOS Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end. EOS Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England. EOS This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. EOS Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. EOS His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis. EOS And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night. EOS Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed. EOS “Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to Paris, under an escort.”  “Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense with the escort.”  “Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket. EOS “Peace, aristocrat!”  “It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary. EOS “You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.”  “I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay. EOS “Rise and dress yourself, emigrant.”  Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire. EOS The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him. EOS The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist. EOS In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads. EOS In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital. EOS They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell. EOS Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made. EOS Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?”  “You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed aristocrat!”  The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him be; let him be! EOS “Ay! EOS and condemned as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval. EOS I am not a traitor.”  “He lies!” cried the smith. EOS “He is a traitor since the decree. EOS His cursed life is not his own!”  At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. EOS “What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard. EOS “Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”  “When passed?”  “On the fourteenth.”  “The day I left England!”  “Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return. EOS It is all the same. EOS What would you have?”  They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. EOS Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. EOS After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song. EOS Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. EOS The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it. EOS “Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard. EOS Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for. EOS Casting his eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention. EOS Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult. EOS A numerous medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through the barrier very slowly. EOS Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. EOS The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women. EOS Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount. EOS He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. EOS The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly uncertain condition. EOS Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these. EOS “Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of paper to write on. EOS “Is this the emigrant Evremonde?”  “This is the man.”  “Your age, Evremonde?”  “Thirty-seven.”  “Married, Evremonde?”  “Yes.”  “Where married?”  “In England.”  “Without doubt. EOS Where is your wife, Evremonde?”  “In England.”  “Without doubt. EOS “We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing. EOS “I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. EOS The officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”  Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him. EOS “Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”  “Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise. EOS “My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine. EOS Possibly you have heard of me.”  “My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? EOS Yes!”  The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”  “You heard me say why, a minute ago. EOS “Indeed I am lost here. EOS All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. EOS Will you render me a little help?”  “None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him. EOS “Will you answer me a single question?”  “Perhaps. EOS According to its nature. EOS He, therefore, made haste to say:  “It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force. EOS Will you cause that to be done for me?”  “I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. EOS My duty is to my country and the People. EOS I will do nothing for you.”  Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides. EOS As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets. EOS The very children scarcely noticed him. EOS A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work. EOS The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. EOS On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. EOS That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. EOS He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days. EOS Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope. EOS The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. EOS The “sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name. EOS Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. EOS With this on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he arrived at the prison of La Force. EOS A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented “The Emigrant Evremonde.”  “What the Devil! EOS How many more of them!” exclaimed the man with the bloated face. EOS Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots. EOS “What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife. EOS “How many more!”  The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion. EOS The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. EOS Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for! EOS “As if I was not already full to bursting!”  He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates. EOS The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room. EOS In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. EOS But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life. EOS Ghosts all! EOS It struck him motionless. EOS The gaoler standing at his side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost. EOS May it soon terminate happily! EOS It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?”  Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he could find. EOS “But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”  “I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.”  “Ah, what a pity! EOS We so much regret it! EOS But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform the society--in secret.”  There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave him good wishes and encouragement. EOS When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. EOS “Why am I confined alone?”  “How do I know!”  “I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”  “Such are not my orders. EOS You will be visited, and can ask then. EOS At present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”  There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. EOS When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.”  “Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. EOS “The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. EOS * * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. EOS * * * * Five paces by four and a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them. EOS The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. EOS Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. EOS For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments. EOS A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris, would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette. EOS For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter? EOS Yet such things were. EOS Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his money. EOS He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. EOS It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that. EOS All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty. EOS On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood. EOS Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop. EOS Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. EOS “Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. EOS May He have mercy on all who are in danger!”  Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, “They have come back!” and sat listening. EOS The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused. EOS Lucie! EOS What has brought you here? EOS Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. EOS “Don't look!” cried Mr. Lorry. EOS “Don't look out! EOS In France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph. EOS I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.--What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window. EOS “No, Lucie, my dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. EOS “Don't be so terrified, my love. EOS I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. EOS What prison is he in?”  “La Force!”  “La Force! EOS There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. EOS I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. EOS You must let me put you in a room at the back here. EOS You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay.”  “I will be submissive to you. EOS I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this. EOS The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot. EOS As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. EOS The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood. EOS Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through. EOS And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun. EOS All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there. EOS “They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. EOS Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts. EOS He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. EOS Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand. EOS O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! EOS “Hush! EOS The soldiers' swords are sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. EOS A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air. EOS Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions. EOS III. EOS The Shadow   One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof. EOS His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business. EOS At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. EOS But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings. EOS As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes. EOS To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself. EOS He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations. EOS A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him. EOS He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. EOS In a few moments, a man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his name. EOS “Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS I come from Doctor Manette.”  “And what says he? EOS What does he send me?”  Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. EOS It bore the words in the Doctor's writing:      “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. EOS I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note      from Charles to his wife. EOS Let the bearer see his wife.”  It was dated from La Force, within an hour. EOS “Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”  “Yes,” returned Defarge. EOS Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard. EOS There, they found two women; one, knitting. EOS “Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago. EOS “It is she,” observed her husband. EOS “Yes. EOS It is for their safety.”  Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him, and led the way. EOS They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone. EOS She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him. EOS “DEAREST,--Take courage. EOS I am well, and your father has       influence around me. EOS You cannot answer this. EOS Kiss our child for me.”  That was all the writing. EOS It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again. EOS She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. EOS Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare. EOS “My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. EOS “You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our good Pross. EOS Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.”  The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! EOS I hope _you_ are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her. EOS “Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate. EOS “Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child.”  The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. EOS We may go.”  But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:  “You will be good to my poor husband. EOS You will do him no harm. EOS “It is the daughter of your father who is my business here.”  “For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. EOS She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. EOS We are more afraid of you than of these others.”  Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. EOS Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression. EOS “Let it do so.”  “As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. EOS O sister-woman, think of me. EOS As a wife and mother!”  Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The Vengeance:  “The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? EOS Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?”  She resumed her knitting and went out. EOS The Vengeance followed. EOS Defarge went last, and closed the door. EOS “Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. EOS “Courage, courage! EOS So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls. EOS Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”  “I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes.”  “Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave little breast? EOS A shadow indeed! EOS No substance in it, Lucie.”  But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly. EOS IV. EOS So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. EOS She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered. EOS That, in the prison he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells. EOS That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge. EOS That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life and liberty. EOS That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. EOS That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. EOS That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over. EOS The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. EOS One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. EOS As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger. EOS “It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. EOS And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed. EOS While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. EOS He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad. EOS This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. EOS Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. EOS The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. EOS Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. EOS The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. EOS The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. EOS There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. EOS Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. EOS Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. EOS Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey. EOS A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old. EOS Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine. EOS It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack. EOS It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. EOS It superseded the Cross. EOS Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied. EOS It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red. EOS It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. EOS It hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good. EOS Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes. EOS The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every day. EOS Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last. EOS Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head. EOS No man better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger situation. EOS In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. EOS He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals. EOS V. The Wood-Sawyer   One year and three months. EOS Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. EOS Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine! EOS If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. EOS But, from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. EOS She was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be. EOS Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time. EOS Little Lucie she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. EOS The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind. EOS She did not greatly alter in appearance. EOS The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. EOS She lost her colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. EOS Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him. EOS But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”  “O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.”  From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. EOS As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. EOS It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. EOS On the third day of her being there, he noticed her. EOS “Good day, citizeness.”  “Good day, citizen.”  This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. EOS It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody. EOS “But it's not my business,” said he. EOS Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared. EOS Walking here again, citizeness?”  “Yes, citizen.”  “Ah! EOS A child too! EOS Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”  “Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her. EOS “Yes, dearest.”  “Yes, citizen.”  “Ah! EOS My work is my business. EOS See my saw! EOS La, la, la; La, la, la! EOS “I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. EOS See here again! EOS And off _her_ head comes! EOS Now, a child. EOS Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! EOS And off _its_ head comes. EOS Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received. EOS He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. EOS “But it's not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again. EOS In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall. EOS Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together. EOS It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week. EOS These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. EOS He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. EOS On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”--for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised. EOS A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance. EOS There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. EOS There was no other music than their own singing. EOS They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. EOS Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together. EOS At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. EOS While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. EOS The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time. EOS As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been. EOS I have seen it many times. EOS Don't be frightened! EOS But when I think of my husband, and the mercies of these people--”  “We will set him above their mercies very soon. EOS I left him climbing to the window, and I came to tell you. EOS Madame Defarge. EOS “I salute you, citizeness,”  from the Doctor. EOS “I salute you, citizen.” This in passing. EOS Nothing more. EOS Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road. EOS “Give me your arm, my love. EOS That was well done;” they had left the spot; “it shall not be in vain. EOS Charles is summoned for to-morrow.”  “For to-morrow!”  “There is no time to lose. EOS You are not afraid?”  She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”  “Do so, implicitly. EOS They both knew too well what it meant. EOS One. EOS Two. EOS Three. EOS Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow. EOS “I must see Lorry,” the Doctor repeated, turning her another way. EOS The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. EOS He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national. EOS What he could save for the owners, he saved. EOS No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to hold his peace. EOS The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted. EOS Republic One and Indivisible. EOS Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair--who must not be seen? EOS From whom newly arrived, did he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? EOS To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued, he said: “Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?”     VI. EOS Triumph   The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. EOS Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. EOS The standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!”  “Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!”  So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force. EOS When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. EOS Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so. EOS There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten. EOS The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. EOS It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening. EOS The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. EOS Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. EOS In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. EOS Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. EOS All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half. EOS Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. EOS She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge. EOS He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. EOS As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole. EOS Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. EOS It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France. EOS “An enemy to the Republic!”  The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England? EOS Undoubtedly it was. EOS What did he call himself? EOS Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law. EOS Why not? EOS Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France. EOS What proof had he of this? EOS But he had married in England? EOS True, but not an English woman. EOS A citizeness of France? EOS Yes. EOS By birth. EOS Her name and family? EOS “Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.”  This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. EOS So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him. EOS The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road. EOS The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner? EOS He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature. EOS He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his absence. EOS He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. EOS Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic? EOS Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”  until they left off, of their own will. EOS The President required the name of that citizen. EOS The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. EOS He also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President. EOS Doctor Manette was next questioned. EOS His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. EOS At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them. EOS All the voices were in the prisoner's favour, and the President declared him free. EOS Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage. EOS No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. EOS No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets. EOS His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. EOS Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed. EOS So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours. EOS On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore. EOS In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine. EOS In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. EOS Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. EOS Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole. EOS Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away. EOS “Lucie! EOS My own! EOS I am safe.”  “O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him.”  They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. EOS “You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated; “don't tremble so. EOS I have saved him.”     VII. EOS A Knock at the Door   “I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here. EOS The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. EOS Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more. EOS Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. EOS No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! EOS He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. EOS Let them all lean upon him. EOS Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners. EOS It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. EOS Mr. Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. EOS In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed. EOS In the Doctor's little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops. EOS To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire. EOS For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket. EOS Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful. EOS So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. EOS He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down. EOS We want wine, among the rest. EOS Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! EOS May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”  “I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling. EOS “For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that,” said Miss Pross. EOS “But the question, Doctor Manette. EOS Is there”--it was the good creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--“is there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”  “I fear not yet. EOS It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”  “Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we must have patience and wait: that's all. EOS We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. EOS Now, Mr. EOS All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been. EOS “What is that?” she cried, all at once. EOS What a disordered state you are in! EOS _You_, your father's daughter!”  “I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”  “My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”  As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door. EOS What can this be! EOS Save him!”  “My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, “I _have_ saved him. EOS What weakness is this, my dear! EOS Let me go to the door.”  He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it. EOS “I seek him. EOS You are again the prisoner of the Republic.”  The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him. EOS “Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”  “It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will know to-morrow. EOS You are summoned for to-morrow.”  Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red woollen shirt, said:  “You know him, you have said. EOS Do you know me?”  “Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.”  “We all know you, Citizen Doctor,” said the other three. EOS He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause:  “Will you answer his question to me then? EOS How does this happen?”  “Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. EOS If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. EOS The Republic goes before all. EOS Evremonde, we are pressed.”  “One word,” the Doctor entreated. EOS Who moved uneasily on his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:  “Well! EOS But he is denounced--and gravely--by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. EOS And by one other.”  “What other?”  “Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?”  “Yes.”  “Then,” said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, “you will be answered to-morrow. EOS Now, I am dumb!”     VIII. EOS A Hand at Cards   Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make. EOS Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. EOS They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. EOS Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted. EOS It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest. EOS Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted. EOS As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart. EOS In going, he had to face Miss Pross. EOS In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. EOS That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. EOS Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English. EOS But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. EOS “Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. EOS “After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!”  “Don't call me Solomon. EOS Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way. EOS “Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. EOS “Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”  “Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you want to speak to me. EOS Pay for your wine, and come out. EOS Cruncher.”  “Let him come out too,” said Solomon. EOS He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. EOS “Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you want?”  “How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.”  “There. EOS Confound it! EOS “Now are you content?”  Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence. EOS If you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. EOS I am busy. EOS I am an official.”  “My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners! EOS I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his--”  “I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. EOS “I knew it. EOS I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. EOS Just as I am getting on!”  “The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. EOS Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer.”  Good Miss Pross! EOS As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers. EOS He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question:  “I say! EOS Might I ask the favour? EOS As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?”  The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. EOS “Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. EOS “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) EOS “John Solomon, or Solomon John? EOS Which of the two goes first? EOS That warn't your name over the water.”  “What do you mean?”  “Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water.”  “No?”  “No. EOS But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.”  “Indeed?”  “Yes. EOS T'other one's was one syllable. EOS You was a spy--witness at the Bailey. EOS The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. EOS “Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. EOS I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. EOS I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. EOS “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. EOS You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. EOS Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. EOS I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. EOS And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”  “What purpose?” the spy asked. EOS Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?”  “Under a threat?”  “Oh! EOS Did I say that?”  “Then, why should I go there?”  “Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.”  “Do you mean that you won't say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked. EOS “You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. EOS I won't.”  Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind, and with such a man as he had to do with. EOS “Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing.”  “Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. EOS “Don't be ungrateful. EOS Do you go with me to the Bank?”  “I'll hear what you have got to say. EOS Yes, I'll go with you.”  “I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street. EOS Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. EOS This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. EOS They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. EOS John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side. EOS Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. EOS He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. EOS “Miss Pross's brother, sir,” said Sydney. EOS “Mr. EOS Barsad.”  “Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? EOS I have an association with the name--and with the face.”  “I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton, coolly. EOS Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the relationship. EOS I pass to worse news. EOS Darnay has been arrested again.”  Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you tell me! EOS When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”  “Just now, if at all.”  “Mr. EOS Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. EOS He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. EOS There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.”  Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. EOS Barsad?--”  “Yes; I believe so.”  “--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. EOS “But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law.”  “That's true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton. EOS “In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. EOS Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one. EOS No man's life here is worth purchase. EOS “I'll run them over. EOS Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. EOS That's a very good card. EOS Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. EOS That's a card not to be beaten. EOS Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?”  “Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. EOS Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. EOS He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. EOS Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful. EOS Take time.”  It was a poorer hand than he suspected. EOS Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. EOS He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. EOS He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. EOS He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. EOS Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life. EOS “Do you play?”  “I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr. Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken. EOS “Well; he may be.”  “Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it's not important.”  “Though it's not important,” repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way--“though it's not important--No, it's not important. EOS No. EOS It can't be,” said the spy. EOS “It-can't-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. EOS Spoke good French. EOS Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind. EOS Disguised, but the same man. EOS Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. EOS I attended him in his last illness. EOS He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. EOS Tracing it to its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head. EOS “Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair. EOS To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, “ever since. EOS There it is. EOS Oh, look at it, look at it! EOS You may take it in your hand; it's no forgery.”  Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. EOS His hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built. EOS Not he! EOS I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”  The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry. EOS “I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin. EOS Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. EOS Me and two more knows it.”  “How do you know it?”  “What's that to you? EOS “At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is ill-conwenient for explainin'. EOS Let him say he was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; “or I'll out and announce him.”  “Humph! EOS I see one thing,” said Carton. EOS Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again! EOS Do you play?”  “No!” returned the spy. EOS Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”  “Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; “you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. EOS And look here! EOS Once more!”--Mr. Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality--“I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”  The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said, with more decision, “It has come to a point. EOS I go on duty soon, and can't overstay my time. EOS Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. EOS Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. EOS In short, I should make that choice. EOS You talk of desperation. EOS We are all desperate here. EOS Remember! EOS I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. EOS You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”  “I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,”  said the spy, firmly. EOS “Why need you tell me what I have not asked? EOS You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”  “I am sometimes.”  “You can be when you choose?”  “I can pass in and out when I choose.”  Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. EOS The Game Made   While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. EOS “Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “Come here.”  Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him. EOS “What have you been, besides a messenger?”  After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral character.”  “My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description. EOS If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret. EOS Tellson's shall not be imposed upon.”  “I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it is, but even if it wos. EOS There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his fardens--fardens! EOS no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! EOS no, nor yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages--ah! EOS Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. EOS For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. EOS And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark ruinating! EOS Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without t'other? EOS Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get much by it, even if it wos so. EOS And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. EOS “No, I will _not_, sir,” returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice--“which I don't say it is--wot I would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. EOS That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. EOS A man don't see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of things. EOS And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep' it back.”  “That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “Say no more now. EOS It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in action--not in words. EOS “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former; “our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”  He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. EOS When they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done? EOS “Not much. EOS If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once.”  Mr. Lorry's countenance fell. EOS “You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered voice. EOS “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. EOS I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. EOS And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. EOS You are free from that misfortune, however.”  Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. EOS It would not enable Her to go to see him. EOS She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”  Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. EOS Don't speak of me to her. EOS As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. EOS I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. EOS You are going to her, I hope? EOS She must be very desolate to-night.”  “I am going now, directly.”  “I am glad of that. EOS She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you. EOS A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. EOS His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot. EOS “I forgot it,” he said. EOS Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. EOS Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression. EOS “Yes. EOS I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. EOS “Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully. EOS Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”  “See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. EOS your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?”  “You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”  Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said:  “I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? EOS Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?”  Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:  “Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. EOS For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning. EOS It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. EOS My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old! EOS “And you are the better for it?”  “I hope so.”  Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you are young.”  “Yes,” said Carton. EOS “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age. EOS Enough of me.”  “And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “Are you going out?”  “I'll walk with you to her gate. EOS If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. EOS You go to the Court to-morrow?”  “Yes, unhappily.”  “I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. EOS My Spy will find a place for me. EOS Take my arm, sir.”  Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. EOS Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. EOS “Good night, citizen.”  “How goes the Republic?”  “You mean the Guillotine. EOS Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. EOS We shall mount to a hundred soon. EOS He is so droll, that Samson. EOS Such a Barber!”  “Do you often go to see him--”  “Shave? EOS Always. EOS Every day. EOS What a barber! EOS Less than two pipes. EOS “But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear English dress?”  “Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder. EOS “You speak like a Frenchman.”  “I am an old student here.”  “Aha, a perfect Frenchman! EOS Good night, Englishman.”  “Good night, citizen.”  “But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after him. EOS “And take a pipe with you!”  Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper. EOS Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. EOS “Whew!” the chemist whistled softly, as he read it. EOS “Hi! EOS You know the consequences of mixing them?”  “Perfectly.”  Certain small packets were made and given to him. EOS It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end. EOS Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. EOS These solemn words, which had been read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him. EOS “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”  In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep, might have been easily found. EOS He did not seek it, but repeated them and went on. EOS At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud. EOS He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss. EOS The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky. EOS Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death's dominion. EOS But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays. EOS And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it. EOS The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness. EOS He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank. EOS When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--“Like me.”  A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. EOS As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”  Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. EOS The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd. EOS Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. EOS She was there, sitting beside her father. EOS When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. EOS If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly. EOS Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. EOS Every eye was turned to the jury. EOS The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after. EOS Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. EOS A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. EOS The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer. EOS No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. EOS Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. EOS Released yesterday. EOS Indictment delivered to him last night. EOS Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. EOS Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law. EOS To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor. EOS “Openly, President.”  “By whom?”  “Three voices. EOS You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. EOS My daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. EOS Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!”  “Citizen Manette, be tranquil. EOS To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. EOS As to what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic.”  Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. EOS The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed. EOS “If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. EOS In the meanwhile, be silent!”  Frantic acclamations were again raised. EOS Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. EOS The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth. EOS “You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?”  “I believe so.”  Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: “You were one of the best patriots there. EOS Why not say so? EOS Patriots, I speak the truth!”  It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings. EOS The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that bell!”  wherein she was likewise much commended. EOS He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. EOS It falls. EOS I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler. EOS I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. EOS This is the writing of Doctor Manette. EOS X. EOS I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. EOS “These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. EOS “The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. EOS I answered. EOS “I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. EOS “'You are Doctor Manette?' EOS said one. EOS “I am.”  “'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?' EOS “'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. EOS Will you please to enter the carriage?' EOS “The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. EOS They were armed. EOS I was not. EOS “The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. EOS 'Doctor, your clients are people of condition. EOS As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. EOS Enough. EOS Will you please to enter the carriage?' EOS “I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. EOS The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed. EOS I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same. EOS *****  “The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road. EOS At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. EOS “The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty. EOS Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. EOS I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman's dress. EOS “I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her face. EOS and then counted up to twelve, and said, 'Hush!' EOS For an instant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' EOS There was no cessation, but the regular moment's pause, in the utterance of these sounds. EOS “'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?' EOS It was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.' EOS “'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?' EOS “'A brother.' EOS “'She has some recent association with the number twelve?' EOS If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided. EOS There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.' EOS “The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table. EOS asked the younger brother. EOS “'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no more. EOS “I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give. EOS As I intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed. EOS There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner. EOS The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. EOS Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks. EOS the counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!' EOS The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful. EOS It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular. EOS “For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said:  “'There is another patient.' EOS “I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?' EOS “'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light. EOS There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across. EOS Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. EOS I had to pass through that part, to get at the other. EOS My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. EOS I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night. EOS I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point. EOS “'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. EOS 'Let me examine it.' EOS “It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away. EOS As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature. EOS A serf! EOS “There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. EOS The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. EOS He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy, or about his fate. EOS “'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes. EOS She--have you seen her, Doctor?' EOS “The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance. EOS He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence. EOS “I said, 'I have seen her.' EOS “'She is my sister, Doctor. EOS They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us. EOS She was a good girl. EOS The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.' EOS “'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!' EOS “I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire. EOS I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy. EOS “'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. EOS He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. EOS She had not been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among us! EOS What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her willing?' EOS “The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. EOS The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge. EOS They so harnessed him and drove him. EOS You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed. EOS They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. EOS But he was not persuaded. EOS No! EOS He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound. EOS I saw her pass me on the road. EOS When I took the tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it. EOS It was somewhere here?' EOS “The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him. EOS He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip. EOS But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw. EOS Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust at me with all his skill for his life.' EOS “My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay. EOS In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's. EOS Where is he?' EOS “'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referred to the brother. EOS “'He! EOS Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. EOS Turn my face to him.' EOS But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him. EOS “'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them. EOS “Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air. EOS He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead. EOS *****  “When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity. EOS I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave. EOS “I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced. EOS She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. EOS They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother! EOS One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. EOS “This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. EOS I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter. EOS “It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm. EOS “'Is she dead?' EOS “'What strength there is in these common bodies!' EOS he said, looking down at her with some curiosity. EOS “'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and despair.' EOS He moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice,  “'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited. EOS I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen. EOS “Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. EOS There was life, and no more. EOS There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers. EOS “She lingered for a week. EOS Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. EOS But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too. EOS “I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy. EOS As often as I caught the younger brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy. EOS He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. EOS I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too. EOS I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended. EOS “The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away. EOS I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down. EOS said the elder, when I went in. EOS “'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round. EOS “He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. EOS He now gave me a rouleau of gold. EOS I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing. EOS “They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on either side. EOS “Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box, with my name on the outside. EOS I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. EOS I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed. EOS “I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. EOS It was the last day of the year. EOS The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me. EOS *****  “I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. EOS She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. EOS I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately. EOS “My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation. EOS She had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's share in it, and my being resorted to. EOS Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman's sympathy. EOS I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. EOS Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. EOS *****  “These scraps of paper fail me. EOS One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday. EOS “She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. EOS How could she be! EOS The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too. EOS “'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can. EOS He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise. EOS I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. EOS “She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear sake. EOS Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' EOS The child answered her bravely, 'Yes!' EOS I never saw her more. EOS “As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter. EOS When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart! EOS My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him. EOS “An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. EOS “It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. EOS When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned. EOS The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. EOS The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot. EOS I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave. EOS “If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. EOS But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies. EOS I denounce them to Heaven and to earth.”  A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. EOS The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it. EOS Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register. EOS One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people's altar. EOS Therefore when the President said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy. EOS “Much influence around him, has that Doctor?” murmured Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. EOS “Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”  At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. EOS Another and another. EOS Roar and roar. EOS Unanimously voted. EOS At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. EOS “If I might touch him! EOS The people had all poured out to the show in the streets. EOS Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms. EOS “Farewell, dear darling of my soul. EOS We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”  They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom. EOS I am supported from above: don't suffer for me. EOS A parting blessing for our child.”  “I send it to her by you. EOS I kiss her by you. EOS No! EOS A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from her. EOS “We shall not be separated long. EOS I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”  Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:  “No, no! EOS We know now, what a struggle you made of old. EOS We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake. EOS Heaven be with you!”  Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish. EOS “It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner. EOS It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. EOS Be comforted, and forgive me. EOS Heaven bless you!”  As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. EOS His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head. EOS Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a flush of pride in it. EOS I shall never feel her weight.”  He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach. EOS When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase to their rooms. EOS “Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! EOS Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?”  He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. EOS “Before I go,” he said, and paused--“I may kiss her?”  It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. EOS The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”  When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:  “You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. EOS I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly. EOS The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.”  “I intend to try. EOS I will not rest a moment.”  “That's well. EOS But try! EOS I will write too, and--But stay! EOS There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.”  “That's true. EOS Well! EOS It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark. EOS I should like to know how you speed; though, mind! EOS I expect nothing! EOS When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?”  “Immediately after dark, I should hope. EOS If I go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?”  “Yes.”  “May you prosper!”  Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn. EOS “I have no hope,” said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper. EOS “Nor have I.”  “If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.”  “And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.”  Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it. EOS “Don't despond,” said Carton, very gently; “don't grieve. EOS Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her.”  “Yes, yes, yes,” returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right. EOS But he will perish; there is no real hope.”  “Yes. EOS He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton. EOS And walked with a settled step, down-stairs. EOS Darkness   Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. EOS “At Tellson's banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. EOS “Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? EOS I think so. EOS It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. EOS But care, care, care! EOS His first impression was confirmed. EOS “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine. EOS Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. EOS It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question. EOS Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. EOS For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. EOS Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it. EOS This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife. EOS He repeated what he had already said. EOS “English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows. EOS After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent. EOS “Yes, madame, yes. EOS I am English!”  Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evremonde!”  Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening. EOS “How?”  “Good evening.”  “Oh! EOS Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass. EOS And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!”  Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. EOS They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. EOS Why stop?”  “Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. EOS After all, the question is still where?”  “At extermination,” said madame. EOS “Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. EOS The Vengeance, also, highly approved. EOS “Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. EOS But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read.”  “I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. EOS I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic. EOS Let him take care of his face!”  “And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, “the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”  “I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. EOS I have observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days. EOS “She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her. EOS “As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this man even now.”  “No!” protested Defarge. EOS “Not if to lift this glass would do it! EOS I say, stop there.”  “See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! EOS Listen! EOS For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination. EOS “In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp. EOS Ask him, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge. EOS “That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. EOS Ask him, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge again. EOS “I communicate to him that secret. EOS I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family. EOS Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!' EOS Ask him, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge once more. EOS “Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but don't tell me.”  Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her--and both highly commended it. EOS Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road. EOS The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep. EOS But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. EOS He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment. EOS Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four o'clock. EOS She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. EOS He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be? EOS Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight. EOS He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back. EOS Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none. EOS Where could he be? EOS The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost. EOS As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything. EOS “I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. EOS Where is it?”  His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor. EOS “Where is my bench? EOS I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can't find it. EOS What have they done with my work? EOS Time presses: I must finish those shoes.”  They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them. EOS “Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful cry; “but give me my work! EOS What is to become of us, if those shoes are not done to-night?”  Lost, utterly lost! EOS It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him, that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his work presently. EOS He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears. EOS Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. EOS His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly. EOS Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces. EOS Yes; he had better be taken to her. EOS Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”  “I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. EOS They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night. EOS Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. EOS “We should look at this!” he said. EOS He opened it, and exclaimed, “Thank _God!_”  “What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly. EOS Let me speak of it in its place. EOS Look at it. EOS You see?”  “Yes!”  “Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. EOS When is it dated? EOS But no matter; don't stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own. EOS I never doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. EOS It is good, until recalled. EOS But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.”  “They are not in danger?”  “They are in great danger. EOS They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge. EOS I know it from her own lips. EOS I have overheard words of that woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. EOS I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. EOS He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned Lucie's name--“making signs and signals to prisoners. EOS It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life--and perhaps her child's--and perhaps her father's--for both have been seen with her at that place. EOS Don't look so horrified. EOS You will save them all.”  “Heaven grant I may, Carton! EOS It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man. EOS She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. EOS Your preparations have been completed for some days, to return to England. EOS Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon.”  “It shall be done!”  His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth. EOS Tell her that it was her husband's last arrangement. EOS I hope to do my part faithfully.”  “And I hope to do mine. EOS He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have. EOS He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night. EOS He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room. EOS Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell. EOS Fifty-two   In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate. EOS They were in number as the weeks of the year. EOS Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. EOS Two score and twelve were told off. EOS From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. EOS Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction. EOS In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. EOS He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing. EOS Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. EOS His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again. EOS If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing. EOS But, all this was at first. EOS Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him. EOS Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. EOS So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down. EOS Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way. EOS He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. EOS If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. EOS To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. EOS That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done. EOS His mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him. EOS Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away. EOS And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master. EOS He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. EOS The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again. EOS Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. EOS After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better of it. EOS Twelve gone for ever. EOS He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets. EOS Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others. EOS The hour had measured like most other hours. EOS Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. EOS He stopped. EOS The key was put in the lock, and turned. EOS Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never seen me here; I have kept out of his way. EOS Lose no time!”  The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton. EOS But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's hand, and it was his real grasp. EOS “I could not believe it to be you. EOS I can scarcely believe it now. EOS You are not”--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--“a prisoner?”  “No. EOS I come from her--your wife, dear Darnay.”  The prisoner wrung his hand. EOS “You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no time to tell you. EOS You must comply with it--take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine.”  There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner. EOS Quick!”  “Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. EOS When I ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. EOS Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. EOS While you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like this of mine!”  With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him. EOS The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. EOS “Carton! EOS It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. EOS When I ask that, refuse. EOS There are pen and ink and paper on this table. EOS Is your hand steady enough to write?”  “It was when you came in.”  “Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. EOS “Write exactly as I speak.”  “To whom do I address it?”  “To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast. EOS '”  He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. EOS “I have. EOS Is that a weapon in your hand?”  “No; I am not armed.”  “What is it in your hand?”  “You shall know directly. EOS Write on; there are but a few words more.” He dictated again. EOS “'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. EOS '” As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. EOS “What vapour is that?” he asked. EOS Take up the pen and finish. EOS Hurry, hurry!”  As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. EOS As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. EOS “'If it had been otherwise;'” Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; “'I never should have used the longer opportunity. EOS If it had been otherwise--'” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. EOS Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. EOS For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground. EOS Then, he softly called, “Enter there! EOS Come in!” and the Spy presented himself. EOS Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, “my hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.”  “Don't fear me. EOS I will be true to the death.”  “You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. EOS Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.”  “Have no fear! EOS I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God! EOS Now, get assistance and take me to the coach.”  “You?” said the Spy nervously. EOS “Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. EOS You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?”  “Of course.”  “I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out. EOS Quick! EOS Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”  The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands. EOS “How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. EOS “So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine?”  “A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”  They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought to the door, and bent to carry it away. EOS “The time is short, Evremonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice. EOS “Be careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me.”  “Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. EOS Straining his powers of listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm. EOS There was none. EOS Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two. EOS Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then began to be audible. EOS Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his own. EOS Some were standing; some seated. EOS Some were lamenting, and in restless motion; but, these were few. EOS The great majority were silent and still, looking fixedly at the ground. EOS As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him. EOS A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him. EOS “Citizen Evremonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. EOS I forget what you were accused of?”  “Plots. EOS Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. EOS Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?”  The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears started from his eyes. EOS I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen Evremonde. EOS Such a poor weak little creature!”  As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl. EOS I hoped it was true?”  “It was. EOS I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me more courage.”  As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment. EOS He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, and touched his lips. EOS “Are you dying for him?” she whispered. EOS Hush! EOS Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”          *****  The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined. EOS “Who goes here? EOS “Alexandre Manette. EOS French. EOS Which is he?”  This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointed out. EOS “Hah! EOS Many suffer with it. EOS His daughter. EOS French. EOS Which is she?”  This is she. EOS Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?”  It is. EOS Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. EOS Lucie, her child. EOS English. EOS “Kiss me, child of Evremonde. EOS Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it! EOS Advocate. EOS English. EOS Which is he?”  He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. EOS He, too, is pointed out. EOS “Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”  It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. EOS Jarvis Lorry. EOS Banker. EOS English. EOS Which is he?”  “I am he. EOS Necessarily, being the last.”  It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. EOS It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door, replying to a group of officials. EOS “Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.”  “One can depart, citizen?”  “One can depart. EOS A good journey!”  “I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!”  These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and looks upward. EOS Can they not be induced to go faster?”  asks Lucie, clinging to the old man. EOS “It would seem like flight, my darling. EOS The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side. EOS Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there. EOS The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing anything but stopping. EOS Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road? EOS Is not this the same place twice over? EOS Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! EOS Hush! EOS the posting-house. EOS Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results. EOS All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled. EOS At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind. EOS We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds. EOS We are pursued? EOS Within the carriage there. EOS Speak then!”  “What is it?” asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window. EOS “How many did they say?”  “I do not understand you.”  “--At the last post. EOS My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. EOS The Guillotine goes handsomely. EOS I love it. EOS Hi forward. EOS Whoop!”  The night comes on dark. EOS He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him, by his name, what he has in his hand. EOS The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else. EOS XIV. EOS Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. EOS But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”  “It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.”  “See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. EOS He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me. EOS But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.”  “She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. EOS Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little. EOS “The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. EOS And we seldom have a child there. EOS It is a pretty sight!”  “In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, “I cannot trust my husband in this matter. EOS Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape.”  “That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape. EOS We have not half enough as it is. EOS We ought to have six score a day.”  “In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. EOS Come hither, little citizen.”  The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap. EOS “Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge, sternly, “that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?”  “Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer. EOS “Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. EOS “Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. EOS I answer for my fellow-Jurymen.”  “Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. EOS Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? EOS I have no feeling either way. EOS For, I am not a bad witness.”  The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. EOS The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness. EOS “No, I cannot spare him! EOS He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day. EOS Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:  “She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. EOS She will be mourning and grieving. EOS She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic. EOS She will be full of sympathy with its enemies. EOS I will go to her.”  “What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously. EOS “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance; and embraced her. EOS “Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenant's hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. EOS There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. EOS Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances. EOS But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. EOS If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her. EOS If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there. EOS Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. EOS Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. EOS Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol. EOS Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets. EOS Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention. EOS It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. EOS Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. EOS Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded. EOS She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation. EOS “Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: “what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? EOS Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion.”  “My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you're right. EOS Are _you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”  “Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I hope so. EOS Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine, I think not. EOS Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?”  “Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”  “First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o' this, never no more will I do it, never no more!”  “I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”  “No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. EOS Second: them poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!”  “Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”  “I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.”  “There, there, there! EOS Forbid it, miss! EOS “If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. EOS My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!”  Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer. EOS Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar. EOS Alas! EOS Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed. EOS “By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. EOS We don't know what may happen.”  “Heaven knows we don't,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me. EOS Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!”  This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. EOS With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed. EOS The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. EOS She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. EOS Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red. EOS Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. EOS In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room. EOS The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. EOS By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water. EOS Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evremonde; where is she?”  It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. EOS There were four in the room, and she shut them all. EOS She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied. EOS I am an Englishwoman.”  Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. EOS She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. EOS She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy. EOS I wish to see her.”  “I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.”  Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant. EOS “Good patriots will know what that means. EOS Let me see her. EOS Go tell her that I wish to see her. EOS Do you hear?”  “If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me. EOS No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”  Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught. EOS “Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning. EOS “I take no answer from you. EOS Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”  This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm. EOS “I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.”  Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. EOS Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step. EOS I don't care an English Twopence for myself. EOS I'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”  Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath. EOS Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life. EOS But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes. EOS This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. EOS “Ha, ha!” she laughed, “you poor wretch! EOS What are you worth! EOS I address myself to that Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! EOS Wife of Evremonde! EOS Child of Evremonde! EOS Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!”  Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. EOS Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. EOS “Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. EOS There is no one in that room behind you! EOS “If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself. EOS “As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”  “I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said Madame Defarge. EOS Madame Defarge made at the door. EOS Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight. EOS The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman. EOS “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you shall not draw it. EOS I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. EOS I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!”  Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. EOS Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood alone--blinded with smoke. EOS All this was in a second. EOS As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground. EOS Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back. EOS It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. EOS She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away. EOS By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped. EOS She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways. EOS Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder! EOS In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away. EOS “The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect. EOS “I don't hear you,” said Miss Pross. EOS “What do you say?”  It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. EOS “So I'll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at all events she'll see that.” And she did. EOS “I don't hear it.”  “Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; “wot's come to her?”  “I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”  “Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed. EOS “Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up? EOS Hark! EOS There's the roll of them dreadful carts! EOS O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.”  “If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey's end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”  And indeed she never did. EOS Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. EOS All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. EOS And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. EOS Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind. EOS Six tumbrils roll along the streets. EOS Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! EOS No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. EOS “If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so! EOS But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!”  Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along. EOS Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. EOS So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils. EOS Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. EOS Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. EOS Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people. EOS There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question. EOS The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords.

EOS Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against him. EOS If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. EOS He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound.

EOS Let him be at peace.”  But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, Evremonde!” the face of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. EOS The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end.

EOS On one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend. EOS “Therese.”  “Louder,” the woman recommends. EOS Ay! EOS Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee. EOS Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!

EOS The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. EOS Crash!--And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two. EOS The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him. EOS He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thanks him. EOS I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid.”  “They will be rapid. EOS Fear not!”  The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone. EOS “Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? EOS It is better as it is.”  “Yes, yes: better as it is.”  “What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time: she may even live to be old.”  “What then, my gentle sister?”  “Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: “that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”  “It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.”  “You comfort me so much! EOS I am so ignorant. EOS Am I to kiss you now? EOS Is the moment come?”  “Yes.”  She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. EOS The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. EOS She goes next before him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two. EOS “I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”  The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.

EOS The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception of the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. EOS There are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. EOS But no other Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age only but of all. EOS The Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient thinkers ever attained. EOS He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained. EOS The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. EOS The principles of definition, the law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary--these and other great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato. EOS The greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by him (cp. EOS Rep.; Polit. EOS 435, 436 ff), although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g. EOS Rep.). EOS But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,--logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to 'contemplate all truth and all existence' is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered (Soph. EOS 18). EOS Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. EOS The fragment of the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth century. EOS This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of Homer. EOS Tim. EOS We may judge from the noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would have treated this high argument. EOS Laws  iii. EOS 698 ff. EOS ), singing a hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus (v. 78) where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire--'How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas in greatness!' EOS or, more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene (cp. EOS to Critias). EOS Again, Plato may be regarded as the 'captain' ('arhchegoz') or leader of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God, of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary States which are framed upon the same model. EOS Of the Greek authors who at the Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest influence. EOS The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. EOS He is the father of idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature. EOS And many of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been anticipated in a dream by him. EOS The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old man--then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and Polemarchus--then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by Socrates--reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal State which is constructed by Socrates. EOS The first care of the rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality, and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the individual and the State. EOS We are thus led on to the conception of a higher State, in which 'no man calls anything his own,' and in which there is neither 'marrying nor giving in marriage,' and 'kings are philosophers' and 'philosophers are kings;' and there is another and higher education, intellectual as well as moral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth only but of the whole of life. EOS To the perfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts. EOS When 'the wheel has come full circle' we do not begin again with a new period of human life; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. EOS The subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. EOS Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along with them. EOS And the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation of a future life. EOS The division into books, like all similar divisions (Cp. EOS Sir G.C. EOS ii. EOS p 1. EOS ), is probably later than the age of Plato. EOS The natural divisions are five in number;--(1) Book I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, 'I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,' which is introductory; the first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without arriving at any definite result. EOS The third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject of enquiry, and the second State is constructed on principles of communism and ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea of good takes the place of the social and political virtues. EOS In the eighth and ninth books (4) the perversions of States and of the individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analysed in the individual man. EOS Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first (Books I - IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the second (Books V - X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the perversions. EOS These two points of view are really opposed, and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato. EOS Whether this imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan; or from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer's own mind of the struggling elements of thought which are now first brought together by him; or, perhaps, from the composition of the work at different times--are questions, like the similar question about the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinct answer. EOS In the age of Plato there was no regular mode of publication, and an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his friends. EOS But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of the Republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without being himself able to recognise the inconsistency which is obvious to us. EOS For there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for themselves. EOS They do not perceive the want of connexion in their own writings, or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to those who come after them. EOS Tried by this test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be defective, but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different times or by different hands. EOS And the supposition that the Republic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the work to another. EOS The second title, 'Concerning Justice,' is not the one by which the Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and, like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore be assumed to be of later date. EOS Morgenstern and others have asked whether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the construction of the State is the principal argument of the work. EOS The answer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the State is the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society. EOS The one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal of the State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body. EOS In Hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the idea. EOS Or, to use a Platonic image, justice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture. EOS And when the constitution of the State is completed, the conception of justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the same or different names throughout the work, both as the inner law of the individual soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and punishments in another life. EOS The virtues are based on justice, of which common honesty in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice is based on the idea of good, which is the harmony of the world, and is reflected both in the institutions of states and in motions of the heavenly bodies (cp. EOS Tim. EOS The Timaeus, which takes up the political rather than the ethical side of the Republic, and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward world, yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reign over the State, over nature, and over man. EOS Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and modern times. EOS Now in ancient writings, and indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element which was not comprehended in the original design. EOS For the plan grows under the author's hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing; he has not worked out the argument to the end before he begins. EOS The truth is, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; nor need anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the association of ideas, and which does not interfere with the general purpose. EOS What kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in a building, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem which has to be determined relatively to the subject-matter. EOS the Introduction to the Phaedrus). EOS Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, to Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the State? EOS No such inspired creation is at unity with itself, any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces through them. EOS It is not all on the same plane; it easily passes from ideas to myths and fancies, from facts to figures of speech. EOS It is not prose but poetry, at least a great part of it, and ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history. EOS It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has been raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the conversation was held (the year 411 B.C. EOS which is proposed by him will do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a writer who, like Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology (cp. EOS Rep., Symp., 193 A, etc. EOS Yet this may be a question having no answer 'which is still worth asking,' because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in Plato; it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological difficulties, such, for example, as the conjecture of C.F. EOS Hermann, that Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of Plato (cp. EOS Apol. EOS 34 A), or the fancy of Stallbaum that Plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of his Dialogues were written. EOS Cephalus appears in the introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument, and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book. EOS The main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. EOS Among the company are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus, the sons of Cephalus and brothers of Polemarchus, an unknown Charmantides--these are mute auditors; also there is Cleitophon, who once interrupts, where, as in the Dialogue which bears his name, he appears as the friend and ally of Thrasymachus. EOS Cephalus, the patriarch of the house, has been appropriately engaged in offering a sacrifice. EOS He is the pattern of an old man who has almost done with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. EOS He feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger around the memory of the past. EOS He is not one of those who have nothing to say, because their whole mind has been absorbed in making money. EOS Yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood. EOS The respectful attention shown to him by Socrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission imposed upon him by the Oracle, leads him to ask questions of all men, young and old alike, should also be noted. EOS Who better suited to raise the question of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem to be the expression of it? EOS The moderation with which old age is pictured by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic, not only of him, but of Greek feeling generally, and contrasts with the exaggeration of Cicero in the De Senectute. EOS ad Attic. EOS iv. EOS 16), the aged Cephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which follows, and which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety (cp. EOS Lysimachus in the Laches). EOS His 'son and heir' Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene, and will not 'let him off' on the subject of women and children. EOS Like Cephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than principles; and he quotes Simonides (cp. EOS Aristoph. EOS Clouds) as his father had quoted Pindar. EOS But after this he has no more to say; the answers which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates. EOS He is made to admit that justice is a thief, and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts. EOS From his brother Lysias (contra Eratosth.) EOS we learn that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants, but no allusion is here made to his fate, nor to the circumstance that Cephalus and his family were of Syracusan origin, and had migrated from Thurii to Athens. EOS The 'Chalcedonian giant,' Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard in the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according to Plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. EOS He has reached the stage of framing general notions, and in this respect is in advance of Cephalus and Polemarchus. EOS But he is incapable of defending them in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion with banter and insolence. EOS Whether such doctrines as are attributed to him by Plato were really held either by him or by any other Sophist is uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easily grow up--they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers in Thucydides; but we are concerned at present with Plato's description of him, and not with the historical reality. EOS The inequality of the contest adds greatly to the humour of the scene. EOS His determination to cram down their throats, or put 'bodily into their souls' his own words, elicits a cry of horror from Socrates. EOS Nothing is more amusing than his complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten. EOS The play on his name which was made by his contemporary Herodicus (Aris. EOS ), 'thou wast ever bold in battle,' seems to show that the description of him is not devoid of verisimilitude. EOS When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents, Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek tragedy (cp. EOS Introd. EOS to Phaedo), three actors are introduced. EOS At first sight the two sons of Ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the two friends Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo. EOS But on a nearer examination of them the similarity vanishes, and they are seen to be distinct characters. EOS Glaucon is the impetuous youth who can 'just never have enough of fechting' (cp. EOS the character of him in Xen. EOS 6); the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love; the 'juvenis qui gaudet canibus,' and who improves the breed of animals; the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of youthful life. EOS He is full of quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out to the light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not lose faith in the just and true. EOS His weaknesses are several times alluded to by Socrates, who, however, will not allow him to be attacked by his brother Adeimantus. EOS )...The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder objections are commonly put into his mouth. EOS Glaucon is more demonstrative, and generally opens the game. EOS Glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth; Adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of the world. EOS In the second book, when Glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered without regard to their consequences, Adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences; and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book that Socrates fails in making his citizens happy, and is answered that happiness is not the first but the second thing, not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good government of a State. EOS It is Adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism of common sense on the Socratic method of argument, and who refuses to let Socrates pass lightly over the question of women and children. EOS Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive stages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden time, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his life by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of the Sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher, who know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them, and desire to go deeper into the nature of things. EOS These too, like Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one another. EOS Neither in the Republic, nor in any other Dialogue of Plato, is a single character repeated. EOS In the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is depicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues of Plato, and in the Apology. EOS But in the sixth book his enmity towards the Sophists abates; he acknowledges that they are the representatives rather than the corrupters of the world. EOS He also becomes more dogmatic and constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political or the speculative ideas of the real Socrates. EOS In one passage Plato himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates, who had passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions of other men. EOS Mem. EOS ; Phaedo); and a deep thinker like him, in his thirty or forty years of public teaching, could hardly have failed to touch on the nature of family relations, for which there is also some positive evidence in the Memorabilia (Mem.) EOS The Socratic method is nominally retained; and every inference is either put into the mouth of the respondent or represented as the common discovery of him and Socrates. EOS The method of enquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points of view. EOS ); nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology. EOS His favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made of the daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself. EOS 'You,' says Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, 'are so unaccustomed to speak in images.' EOS And this use of examples or images, though truly Socratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of Plato into the form of an allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what has been already described, or is about to be described, in the abstract. EOS The composite animal in Book IX is an allegory of the parts of the soul. EOS The noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in Book VI are a figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in the State which has been described. EOS Other figures, such as the dog, or the marriage of the portionless maiden, or the drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books, also form links of connexion in long passages, or are used to recall previous discussions. EOS Plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him as 'not of this world.' EOS To him, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when they looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and evil. EOS And even in Socrates himself the sterner judgement of the multitude at times passes into a sort of ironical pity or love. EOS Men in general are incapable of philosophy, and are therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as he truly is in his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native force of truth--words which admit of many applications. EOS Their leaders have nothing to measure with, and are therefore ignorant of their own stature. EOS This moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features of Socrates in the Republic. EOS In all the different representations of Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato, and amid the differences of the earlier or later Dialogues, he always retains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth, without which he would have ceased to be Socrates. EOS Leaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the Republic, and then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic ideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of Plato may be read. EOS BOOK I. EOS The Republic opens with a truly Greek scene--a festival in honour of the goddess Bendis which is held in the Piraeus; to this is added the promise of an equestrian torch-race in the evening. EOS Of the numerous company, three only take any serious part in the discussion; nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to the torch-race, or talked, as in the Symposium, through the night. EOS The manner in which the conversation has arisen is described as follows:--Socrates and his companion Glaucon are about to leave the festival when they are detained by a message from Polemarchus, who speedily appears accompanied by Adeimantus, the brother of Glaucon, and with playful violence compels them to remain, promising them not only the torch-race, but the pleasure of conversation with the young, which to Socrates is a far greater attraction. EOS They return to the house of Cephalus, Polemarchus' father, now in extreme old age, who is found sitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice. EOS 'You should come to me oftener, Socrates, for I am too old to go to you; and at my time of life, having lost other pleasures, I care the more for conversation.' EOS Socrates asks him what he thinks of age, to which the old man replies, that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be attributed to the tempers of men, and that age is a time of peace in which the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt. EOS 'And there is something in what they say, Socrates, but not so much as they imagine--as Themistocles replied to the Seriphian, "Neither you, if you had been an Athenian, nor I, if I had been a Seriphian, would ever have been famous," I might in like manner reply to you, Neither a good poor man can be happy in age, nor yet a bad rich man.' EOS Cephalus answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon you, and then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to do injustice through poverty, and never to have deceived anyone, are felt to be unspeakable blessings. EOS Socrates, who is evidently preparing for an argument, next asks, What is the meaning of the word justice? EOS To tell the truth and pay your debts? EOS No more than this? EOS Or must we admit exceptions? EOS Ought I, for example, to put back into the hands of my friend, who has gone mad, the sword which I borrowed of him when he was in his right mind? EOS 'There must be exceptions.' EOS 'And yet,' says Polemarchus, 'the definition which has been given has the authority of Simonides.' EOS Here Cephalus retires to look after the sacrifices, and bequeaths, as Socrates facetiously remarks, the possession of the argument to his heir, Polemarchus... EOS The first explanation has been supported by a saying of Simonides; and now Socrates has a mind to show that the resolution of justice into two unconnected precepts, which have no common principle, fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic. EOS ...He proceeds: What did Simonides mean by this saying of his? EOS He is answered that justice does good to friends and harm to enemies. EOS But in what way good or harm? EOS 'In making alliances with the one, and going to war with the other.' EOS Then in time of peace what is the good of justice? EOS Yes; but how in such partnerships is the just man of more use than any other man? EOS And there is another difficulty: justice, like the art of war or any other art, must be of opposites, good at attack as well as at defence, at stealing as well as at guarding. EOS But then justice is a thief, though a hero notwithstanding, like Autolycus, the Homeric hero, who was 'excellent above all men in theft and perjury'--to such a pass have you and Homer and Simonides brought us; though I do not forget that the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of enemies. EOS And still there arises another question: Are friends to be interpreted as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? EOS And are our friends to be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? EOS The answer is, that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends, and evil to our seeming and real evil enemies--good to the good, evil to the evil. EOS But ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will only make men more evil? EOS In this both Plato and Kheyam rise above the level of many Christian (?) EOS theologians. EOS The first definition of justice easily passes into the second; for the simple words 'to speak the truth and pay your debts' is substituted the more abstract 'to do good to your friends and harm to your enemies.' EOS Either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of life for plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of philosophy. EOS We may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which not only arises out of the conflict of established principles in particular cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is prior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. EOS ...Here Thrasymachus, who has made several attempts to interrupt, but has hitherto been kept in order by the company, takes advantage of a pause and rushes into the arena, beginning, like a savage animal, with a roar. EOS 'Socrates,' he says, 'what folly is this?--Why do you agree to be vanquished by one another in a pretended argument?' EOS 'Listen,' he says, 'my answer is that might is right, justice the interest of the stronger: now praise me.' EOS Let me understand you first. EOS Do you mean that because Polydamas the wrestler, who is stronger than we are, finds the eating of beef for his interest, the eating of beef is also for our interest, who are not so strong? EOS But suppose, says Socrates, that the ruler or stronger makes a mistake--then the interest of the stronger is not his interest. EOS Thrasymachus is saved from this speedy downfall by his disciple Cleitophon, who introduces the word 'thinks;'--not the actual interest of the ruler, but what he thinks or what seems to be his interest, is justice. EOS The contradiction is escaped by the unmeaning evasion: for though his real and apparent interests may differ, what the ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain what he thinks to be his interest. EOS Of course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new interpretation accepted by Thrasymachus himself. EOS But Socrates is not disposed to quarrel about words, if, as he significantly insinuates, his adversary has changed his mind. EOS In what follows Thrasymachus does in fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for he affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. EOS Socrates is quite ready to accept the new position, which he equally turns against Thrasymachus by the help of the analogy of the arts. EOS Every art or science has an interest, but this interest is to be distinguished from the accidental interest of the artist, and is only concerned with the good of the things or persons which come under the art. EOS 'Tell me, Socrates,' he says, 'have you a nurse?' EOS What a question! EOS 'Because, if you have, she neglects you and lets you go about drivelling, and has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep. EOS For you fancy that shepherds and rulers never think of their own interest, but only of their sheep or subjects, whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use, sheep and subjects alike. EOS And experience proves that in every relation of life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer, especially where injustice is on the grand scale, which is quite another thing from the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of temples. EOS The language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the like--all which tends to show (1) that justice is the interest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice.' EOS Thrasymachus, who is better at a speech than at a close argument, having deluged the company with words, has a mind to escape. EOS But the others will not let him go, and Socrates adds a humble but earnest request that he will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate. EOS he says; 'would you have me put the words bodily into your souls?' EOS God forbid! EOS replies Socrates; but we want you to be consistent in the use of terms, and not to employ 'physician' in an exact sense, and then again 'shepherd' or 'ruler' in an inexact,--if the words are strictly taken, the ruler and the shepherd look only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own: whereas you insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office. EOS 'No doubt about it,' replies Thrasymachus. EOS Then why are they paid? EOS Is not the reason, that their interest is not comprehended in their art, and is therefore the concern of another art, the art of pay, which is common to the arts in general, and therefore not identical with any one of them? EOS Nor would any man be a ruler unless he were induced by the hope of reward or the fear of punishment;--the reward is money or honour, the punishment is the necessity of being ruled by a man worse than himself. EOS There is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind do not like being in office, and that therefore they demand pay. EOS ...Enough of this: the other assertion of Thrasymachus is far more important--that the unjust life is more gainful than the just. EOS Thrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than perfect justice, and after a little hesitation he is induced by Socrates to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue and justice vice. EOS At the same time he is weaving a net in which Thrasymachus is finally enclosed. EOS Socrates, in order to test this statement, employs once more the favourite analogy of the arts. EOS There was great difficulty in bringing Thrasymachus to the point; the day was hot and he was streaming with perspiration, and for the first time in his life he was seen to blush. EOS But his other thesis that injustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and Socrates now proceeds to the consideration of this, which, with the assistance of Thrasymachus, he hopes to clear up; the latter is at first churlish, but in the judicious hands of Socrates is soon restored to good-humour: Is there not honour among thieves? EOS Is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice? EOS Not wickedness therefore, but semi-wickedness flourishes in states,--a remnant of good is needed in order to make union in action possible,--there is no kingdom of evil in this world. EOS Another question has not been answered: Is the just or the unjust the happier? EOS To this we reply, that every art has an end and an excellence or virtue by which the end is accomplished. EOS And is not the end of the soul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained? EOS Thrasymachus replies: 'Let this be your entertainment, Socrates, at the festival of Bendis.' EOS Yes; and a very good entertainment with which your kindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. EOS And yet not a good entertainment--but that was my own fault, for I tasted of too many things. EOS At this the modern reader is apt to stumble, because he forgets that Plato is writing in an age when the arts and the virtues, like the moral and intellectual faculties, were still undistinguished. EOS Among early enquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up the void of speculation; and at first the comparison of the arts and the virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious. EOS The next generation cleared up these perplexities; or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis of them. EOS The contemporaries of Plato were in a state of transition, and had not yet fully realized the common-sense distinction of Aristotle, that 'virtue is concerned with action, art with production' (Nic. EOS ), or that 'virtue implies intention and constancy of purpose,' whereas 'art requires knowledge only'. EOS This is implied in the reductio ad absurdum that 'justice is a thief,' and in the dissatisfaction which Socrates expresses at the final result. EOS For those who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed or ill-treated. EOS The second of the three arguments, 'that the just does not aim at excess,' has a real meaning, though wrapped up in an enigmatical form. EOS The mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an ethical one, and even finds a mythological expression in the conception of envy (Greek). EOS 'When workmen strive to do better than well,    They do confound their skill in covetousness.' EOS (King John.) EOS The harmony of the soul and body, and of the parts of the soul with one another, a harmony 'fairer than that of musical notes,' is the true Hellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature. EOS In what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with Thrasymachus, Plato argues that evil is not a principle of strength, but of discord and dissolution, just touching the question which has been often treated in modern times by theologians and philosophers, of the negative nature of evil. EOS In the last argument we trace the germ of the Aristotelian doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end, which again is suggested by the arts. EOS BOOK II. EOS He is not satisfied with the indirect manner in which, at the end of the last book, Socrates had disposed of the question 'Whether the just or the unjust is the happier.' EOS He then asks Socrates in which of the three classes he would place justice. EOS Glaucon thinks that Thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer, and proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in themselves and apart from the results and rewards of them which the world is always dinning in his ears. EOS He will first of all speak of the nature and origin of justice; secondly, of the manner in which men view justice as a necessity and not a good; and thirdly, he will prove the reasonableness of this view. EOS 'To do injustice is said to be a good; to suffer injustice an evil. EOS As the evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good, the sufferers, who cannot also be doers, make a compact that they will have neither, and this compact or mean is called justice, but is really the impossibility of doing injustice. EOS And he who abstains will be regarded by the world as a fool for his pains. EOS Gorgias.) EOS 'And now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust. EOS Imagine the unjust man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily correcting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength--the greatest villain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us place the just in his nobleness and simplicity--being, not seeming--without name or reward--clothed in his justice only--the best of men who is thought to be the worst, and let him die as he has lived. EOS His high character makes him a ruler; he can marry where he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt his enemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better, and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.' EOS He considered that the most important point of all had been omitted:--'Men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards; parents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue. EOS And other advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind, such as wealthy marriages and high offices. EOS The heroes of Musaeus and Eumolpus lie on couches at a festival, with garlands on their heads, enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal drunkenness. EOS 'Take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and prose:--"Virtue," as Hesiod says, "is honourable but difficult, vice is easy and profitable." EOS You may often see the wicked in great prosperity and the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. EOS And mendicant prophets knock at rich men's doors, promising to atone for the sins of themselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and festive games, or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy good or bad by divine help and at a small charge;--they appeal to books professing to be written by Musaeus and Orpheus, and carry away the minds of whole cities, and promise to "get souls out of purgatory;" and if we refuse to listen to them, no one knows what will happen to us. EOS 'When a lively-minded ingenuous youth hears all this, what will be his conclusion? EOS Justice, he reflects, without the appearance of justice, is misery and ruin; injustice has the promise of a glorious life. EOS Appearance is master of truth and lord of happiness. EOS I hear some one saying that "wickedness is not easily concealed," to which I reply that "nothing great is easy." EOS Union and force and rhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know that there are gods? EOS Only from the poets, who acknowledge that they may be appeased by sacrifices. EOS Then why not sin and pay for indulgences out of your sin? EOS For if the righteous are only unpunished, still they have no further reward, while the wicked may be unpunished and have the pleasure of sinning too. EOS 'How can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice? EOS Add good manners, and, as the wise tell us, we shall make the best of both worlds. EOS Who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling at the praises of justice? EOS Even if a man knows the better part he will not be angry with others; for he knows also that more than human virtue is needed to save a man, and that he only praises justice who is incapable of injustice. EOS 'The origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning, heroes, poets, instructors of youth, have always asserted "the temporal dispensation," the honours and profits of justice. EOS This is what I want you to show, Socrates;--other men use arguments which rather tend to strengthen the position of Thrasymachus that "might is right;" but from you I expect better things. EOS The thesis, which for the sake of argument has been maintained by Glaucon, is the converse of that of Thrasymachus--not right is the interest of the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker. EOS Starting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a step further back;--might is still right, but the might is the weakness of the many combined against the strength of the few. EOS There have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which have a family likeness to the speculations of Glaucon; e.g. EOS that power is the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power; or that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are public benefits. EOS The divine right of kings, or more generally of governments, is one of the forms under which this natural feeling is expressed. EOS Nor again is there any evil which has not some accompaniment of good or pleasure; nor any good which is free from some alloy of evil; nor any noble or generous thought which may not be attended by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of self-interest or of self-love. EOS We know that all human actions are imperfect; but we do not therefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive or principle. EOS Such a philosophy is both foolish and false, like that opinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other men to be like himself. EOS And theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of the State, which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected and enlarged by custom and law (although capable also of perversion), any more than they describe the origin of society, which is to be sought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man. EOS Nor do they represent the average character of individuals, which cannot be explained simply on a theory of evil, but has always a counteracting element of good. EOS The two brothers ask Socrates to prove to them that the just is happy when they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily supposed to consist. EOS For the ideal must always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of human life. EOS Neither the Stoical ideal nor the Christian ideal is true as a fact, but they may serve as a basis of education, and may exercise an ennobling influence. EOS And in a few exceptional individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of humanity, the ideal of happiness may be realized in death and misery. EOS This may be the state which the reason deliberately approves, and which the utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain cases to prefer. EOS He is exhibiting Socrates for the first time undergoing the Socratic interrogation. EOS Lastly, (3) the word 'happiness' involves some degree of confusion because associated in the language of modern philosophy with conscious pleasure or satisfaction, which was not equally present to his mind. EOS And still the unjust must appear just; that is 'the homage which vice pays to virtue.' EOS May we not more truly say that the old-fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by Socrates, and becomes equivalent to universal order or well-being, first in the State, and secondly in the individual? EOS He has found a new answer to his old question (Protag. EOS ), 'whether the virtues are one or many,' viz. EOS that one is the ordering principle of the three others. EOS In seeking to establish the purely internal nature of justice, he is met by the fact that man is a social being, and he tries to harmonise the two opposite theses as well as he can. EOS There is no more inconsistency in this than was inevitable in his age and country; there is no use in turning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy, which, from some other point of view, would appear equally inconsistent. EOS Plato does not give the final solution of philosophical questions for us; nor can he be judged of by our standard. EOS The remainder of the Republic is developed out of the question of the sons of Ariston. EOS Three points are deserving of remark in what immediately follows:--First, that the answer of Socrates is altogether indirect. EOS He does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation of the idea of justice, and still less will he be tempted to affirm the Stoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack. EOS He too will frame an ideal, but his ideal comprehends not only abstract justice, but the whole relations of man. EOS His answer in substance amounts to this,--that under favourable conditions, i.e. EOS And the philosopher 'who retires under the shelter of a wall' can hardly have been esteemed happy by him, at least not in this world. EOS Let a man do his duty first, without asking whether he will be happy or not, and happiness will be the inseparable accident which attends him. EOS Only after many struggles of thought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. EOS Thirdly, we may observe the confusion or identification of the individual and the State, of ethics and politics, which pervades early Greek speculation, and even in modern times retains a certain degree of influence. EOS The subtle difference between the collective and individual action of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are sometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human action, whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower ethics to the standard of politics. EOS ...Socrates praises the sons of Ariston, 'inspired offspring of the renowned hero,' as the elegiac poet terms them; but he does not understand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice while their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own arguments. EOS He knows not how to answer them, although he is afraid of deserting justice in the hour of need. EOS He therefore makes a condition, that having weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters first and then go on to the smaller, that is, he must look for justice in the State first, and will then proceed to the individual. EOS Accordingly he begins to construct the State. EOS His first want is food; his second a house; his third a coat. EOS The sense of these needs and the possibility of satisfying them by exchange, draw individuals together on the same spot; and this is the beginning of a State, which we take the liberty to invent, although necessity is the real inventor. EOS There must be first a husbandman, secondly a builder, thirdly a weaver, to which may be added a cobbler. EOS Four or five citizens at least are required to make a city. EOS Now men have different natures, and one man will do one thing better than many; and business waits for no man. EOS Hence there must be a division of labour into different employments; into wholesale and retail trade; into workers, and makers of workmen's tools; into shepherds and husbandmen. EOS A city which includes all this will have far exceeded the limit of four or five, and yet not be very large. EOS But then again imports will be required, and imports necessitate exports, and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the taste of purchasers; also merchants and ships. EOS In the city too we must have a market and money and retail trades; otherwise buyers and sellers will never meet, and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted in vain efforts at exchange. EOS If we add hired servants the State will be complete. EOS Their principal food is meal and flour, and they drink in moderation. EOS They live on the best of terms with each other, and take care not to have too many children. EOS ''Tis a city of pigs, Socrates.' EOS Why, I replied, what do you want more? EOS 'Only the comforts of life,--sofas and tables, also sauces and sweets.' EOS I see; you want not only a State, but a luxurious State; and possibly in the more complex frame we may sooner find justice and injustice. EOS There will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks, barbers, tire-women, nurses, artists; swineherds and neatherds too for the animals, and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is the source. EOS To feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part of our neighbour's land, and they will want a part of ours. EOS And this is the origin of war, which may be traced to the same causes as other political evils. EOS Our city will now require the slight addition of a camp, and the citizen will be converted into a soldier. EOS But then again our old doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten. EOS The art of war cannot be learned in a day, and there must be a natural aptitude for military duties. EOS There will be some warlike natures who have this aptitude--dogs keen of scent, swift of foot to pursue, and strong of limb to fight. EOS And as spirit is the foundation of courage, such natures, whether of men or animals, will be full of spirit. EOS For dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers. EOS The human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which will make them gentle. EOS And how are they to be learned without education? EOS Is any better than the old-fashioned sort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic? EOS Music includes literature, and literature is of two kinds, true and false. EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS he said. EOS I mean that children hear stories before they learn gymnastics, and that the stories are either untrue, or have at most one or two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood. EOS Now early life is very impressible, and children ought not to learn what they will have to unlearn when they grow up; we must therefore have a censorship of nursery tales, banishing some and keeping others. EOS Shall our youth be encouraged to beat their fathers by the example of Zeus, or our citizens be incited to quarrel by hearing or seeing representations of strife among the gods? EOS Shall they listen to the narrative of Hephaestus binding his mother, and of Zeus sending him flying for helping her when she was beaten? EOS Such tales may possibly have a mystical interpretation, but the young are incapable of understanding allegory. EOS We will not suffer the poets to say that he is the steward of good and evil, or that he has two casks full of destinies;--or that Athene and Zeus incited Pandarus to break the treaty; or that God caused the sufferings of Niobe, or of Pelops, or the Trojan war; or that he makes men sin when he wishes to destroy them. EOS But that the deed was evil, and God the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will allow no one, old or young, to utter. EOS This is our first and great principle--God is the author of good only. EOS By himself?--but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change for the worse. EOS Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at night in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. EOS Why should he? EOS For gods as well as men hate the lie in the soul, or principle of falsehood; and as for any other form of lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in certain exceptional cases--what need have the gods of this? EOS For they are not ignorant of antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their enemies, nor is any madman a friend of theirs. EOS This is our second great principle--God is true. EOS Away with the lying dream of Agamemnon in Homer, and the accusation of Thetis against Apollo in Aeschylus... EOS In order to give clearness to his conception of the State, Plato proceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division of labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens. EOS Gradually this community increases; the division of labour extends to countries; imports necessitate exports; a medium of exchange is required, and retailers sit in the market-place to save the time of the producers. EOS These are the steps by which Plato constructs the first or primitive State, introducing the elements of political economy by the way. EOS As he is going to frame a second or civilized State, the simple naturally comes before the complex. EOS On the other hand, when we compare the lively fancy of Plato with the dried-up abstractions of modern treatises on philosophy, we are compelled to say with Protagoras, that the 'mythus is more interesting' (Protag.) EOS In speaking of education Plato rather startles us by affirming that a child must be trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards. EOS Yet this is not very different from saying that children must be taught through the medium of imagination as well as reason; that their minds can only develope gradually, and that there is much which they must learn without understanding. EOS This is also the substance of Plato's view, though he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat differently from modern ethical writers, respecting truth and falsehood. EOS To us, economies or accommodations would not be allowable unless they were required by the human faculties or necessary for the communication of knowledge to the simple and ignorant. EOS We should insist that the word was inseparable from the intention, and that we must not be 'falsely true,' i.e. EOS speak or act falsely in support of what was right or true. EOS Whether their narratives were true or false did not seriously affect the political or social life of Hellas. EOS But in modern times, and in Protestant countries perhaps more than in Catholic, we have been too much inclined to identify the historical with the moral; and some have refused to believe in religion at all, unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of the record. EOS For we should agree with him in placing the moral before the historical truth of religion; and, generally, in disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which necessarily occur in the early stages of all religions. EOS We know also that changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day; and are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism would condemn. EOS We note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology, said to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before Christ by Theagenes of Rhegium, was well established in the age of Plato, and here, as in the Phaedrus, though for a different reason, was rejected by him. EOS That anachronisms whether of religion or law, when men have reached another stage of civilization, should be got rid of by fictions is in accordance with universal experience. EOS Great is the art of interpretation; and by a natural process, which when once discovered was always going on, what could not be altered was explained away. EOS At length the antagonism between the popular and philosophical religion, never so great among the Greeks as in our own age, disappeared, and was only felt like the difference between the religion of the educated and uneducated among ourselves. EOS The Zeus of Homer and Hesiod easily passed into the 'royal mind' of Plato (Philebus); the giant Heracles became the knight-errant and benefactor of mankind. EOS These and still more wonderful transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of Stoics and neo-Platonists in the two or three centuries before and after Christ. EOS The Greek and Roman religions were gradually permeated by the spirit of philosophy; having lost their ancient meaning, they were resolved into poetry and morality; and probably were never purer than at the time of their decay, when their influence over the world was waning. EOS The lie in the soul is a true lie, the corruption of the highest truth, the deception of the highest part of the soul, from which he who is deceived has no power of delivering himself. EOS The greatest unconsciousness of the greatest untruth, e.g. EOS if, in the language of the Gospels (John), 'he who was blind' were to say 'I see,' is another aspect of the state of mind which Plato is describing. EOS The lie in the soul may be further compared with the sin against the Holy Ghost (Luke), allowing for the difference between Greek and Christian modes of speaking. EOS To this is opposed the lie in words, which is only such a deception as may occur in a play or poem, or allegory or figure of speech, or in any sort of accommodation,--which though useless to the gods may be useful to men in certain cases. EOS Socrates is here answering the question which he had himself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman; and he is also contrasting the nature of God and man. EOS For God is Truth, but mankind can only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial, or false. EOS Reserving for another place the greater questions of religion or education, we may note further, (1) the approval of the old traditional education of Greece; (2) the preparation which Plato is making for the attack on Homer and the poets; (3) the preparation which he is also making for the use of economies in the State; (4) the contemptuous and at the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes to the 'Chronique Scandaleuse' of the gods. EOS There is another motive in purifying religion, which is to banish fear; for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death, or who believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below. EOS They must be gently requested not to abuse hell; they may be reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging. EOS Nor must they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages, such as the depressing words of Achilles--'I would rather be a serving-man than rule over all the dead;' and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions, the senseless shadows, the flitting soul mourning over lost strength and youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke, or the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats. EOS The terrors and horrors of Cocytus and Styx, ghosts and sapless shades, and the rest of their Tartarean nomenclature, must vanish. EOS As little can we admit the sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes:--Achilles, the son of Thetis, in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and down the sea-shore in distraction; or Priam, the cousin of the gods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. EOS A good man is not prostrated at the loss of children or fortune. EOS Neither is death terrible to him; and therefore lamentations over the dead should not be practised by men of note; they should be the concern of inferior persons only, whether women or men. EOS Still worse is the attribution of such weakness to the gods; as when the goddesses say, 'Alas! EOS my travail!' EOS and worst of all, when the king of heaven himself laments his inability to save Hector, or sorrows over the impending doom of his dear Sarpedon. EOS Such a character of God, if not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be imitated by them. EOS The description in the Iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the clumsiness of Hephaestus will not be admitted by us. EOS 'Certainly not.' EOS But this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of state; the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler; any more than the patient would tell a lie to his physician, or the sailor to his captain. EOS In the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists in self-control and obedience to authority. EOS Language of the latter kind will not impress self-control on the minds of youth. EOS The amatory exploits of Peirithous and Theseus are equally unworthy. EOS Either these so-called sons of gods were not the sons of gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them, any more than the gods themselves are the authors of evil. EOS What the poets and story-tellers say--that the wicked prosper and the righteous are afflicted, or that justice is another's gain? EOS But in this we are anticipating the definition of justice, and had therefore better defer the enquiry. EOS An instance will make my meaning clear. EOS The first scene in Homer is of the last or mixed kind, being partly description and partly dialogue. EOS But if you throw the dialogue into the 'oratio obliqua,' the passage will run thus: The priest came and prayed Apollo that the Achaeans might take Troy and have a safe return if Agamemnon would only give him back his daughter; and the other Greeks assented, but Agamemnon was wroth, and so on--The whole then becomes descriptive, and the poet is the only speaker left; or, if you omit the narrative, the whole becomes dialogue. EOS These are the three styles--which of them is to be admitted into our State? EOS 'Do you ask whether tragedy and comedy are to be admitted?' EOS Yes, but also something more--Is it not doubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all? EOS Or rather, has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act both tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once? EOS Human nature is coined into very small pieces, and as our guardians have their own business already, which is the care of freedom, they will have enough to do without imitating. EOS If they imitate they should imitate, not any meanness or baseness, but the good only; for the mask which the actor wears is apt to become his face. EOS We cannot allow men to play the parts of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting against the gods,--least of all when making love or in labour. EOS They must not represent slaves, or bullies, or cowards, drunkards, or madmen, or blacksmiths, or neighing horses, or bellowing bulls, or sounding rivers, or a raging sea. EOS A good or wise man will be willing to perform good and wise actions, but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part which he has never practised; and he will prefer to employ the descriptive style with as little imitation as possible. EOS Poets and musicians use either, or a compound of both, and this compound is very attractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar. EOS But our State in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for complexity. EOS And when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers to exhibit himself and his poetry we will show him every observance of respect, but at the same time tell him that there is no room for his kind in our State; we prefer the rough, honest poet, and will not depart from our original models (Laws). EOS A song or ode has three parts,--the subject, the harmony, and the rhythm; of which the two last are dependent upon the first. EOS As we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the mixed Lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and as our citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial harmonies, such as the Ionian and pure Lydian. EOS And as we reject varieties of harmony, we shall also reject the many-stringed, variously-shaped instruments which give utterance to them, and in particular the flute, which is more complex than any of them. EOS The lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town, and the Pan's-pipe in the fields. EOS We only venture to affirm the general principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul should be reflected in them all. EOS Other artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or unseemliness. EOS Sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to the law of simplicity. EOS For our guardians must grow up, not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison and corrupt their souls, but in a land of health and beauty where they will drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences. EOS And of all these influences the greatest is the education given by music, which finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense of beauty and of deformity. EOS At first the effect is unconscious; but when reason arrives, then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as the friend whom he always knew. EOS As in learning to read, first we acquire the elements or letters separately, and afterwards their combinations, and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know the letters themselves;--in like manner we must first attain the elements or essential forms of the virtues, and then trace their combinations in life and experience. EOS Enough has been said of music, which makes a fair ending with love. EOS In the first place the guardians must abstain from strong drink, for they should be the last persons to lose their wits. EOS Whether the habits of the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful, for the ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing, and if left off suddenly is apt to endanger health. EOS But our warrior athletes must be wide-awake dogs, and must also be inured to all changes of food and climate. EOS Hence they will require a simpler kind of gymnastic, akin to their simple music; and for their diet a rule may be found in Homer, who feeds his heroes on roast meat only, and gives them no fish although they are living at the sea-side, nor boiled meats which involve an apparatus of pots and pans; and, if I am not mistaken, he nowhere mentions sweet sauces. EOS Where gluttony and intemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders; and law and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a State take an interest in them. EOS But what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home? EOS And yet there IS a worse stage of the same disease--when men have learned to take a pleasure and pride in the twists and turns of the law; not considering how much better it would be for them so to order their lives as to have no need of a nodding justice. EOS And there is a like disgrace in employing a physician, not for the cure of wounds or epidemic disorders, but because a man has by laziness and luxury contracted diseases which were unknown in the days of Asclepius. EOS Eurypylus after he has been wounded drinks a posset of Pramnian wine, which is of a heating nature; and yet the sons of Asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him the drink, nor Patroclus who is attending on him. EOS The truth is that this modern system of nursing diseases was introduced by Herodicus the trainer; who, being of a sickly constitution, by a compound of training and medicine tortured first himself and then a good many other people, and lived a great deal longer than he had any right. EOS 'They must be at their business,' they say, 'and have no time for coddling: if they recover, well; if they don't, there is an end of them.' EOS Whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill. Do you know a maxim of Phocylides--that 'when a man begins to be rich' (or, perhaps, a little sooner) 'he should practise virtue'? EOS When a student imagines that philosophy gives him a headache, he never does anything; he is always unwell. EOS They were acting in the interest of the public, and did not wish to preserve useless lives, or raise up a puny offspring to wretched sires. EOS Honest diseases they honestly cured; and if a man was wounded, they applied the proper remedies, and then let him eat and drink what he liked. EOS But they declined to treat intemperate and worthless subjects, even though they might have made large fortunes out of them. EOS As to the story of Pindar, that Asclepius was slain by a thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie--following our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he was not the son of a god. EOS But the judge controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be corrupted by crime. EOS Where then is he to gain experience? EOS This is the ideal of a judge; the criminal turned detective is wonderfully suspicious, but when in company with good men who have experience, he is at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as himself. EOS Vice may be known of virtue, but cannot know virtue. EOS And the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music which will give harmony to the soul, and good gymnastic which will give health to the body. EOS Not that this division of music and gymnastic really corresponds to soul and body; for they are both equally concerned with the soul, which is tamed by the one and aroused and sustained by the other. EOS While a man is allowing music to pour like water through the funnel of his ears, the edge of his soul gradually wears away, and the passionate or spirited element is melted out of him. EOS There are two principles in man, reason and passion, and to these, not to the soul and body, the two arts of music and gymnastic correspond. EOS First, the elder must rule the younger; and the best of the elders will be the best guardians. EOS Now they will be the best who love their subjects most, and think that they have a common interest with them in the welfare of the state. EOS These we must select; but they must be watched at every epoch of life to see whether they have retained the same opinions and held out against force and enchantment. EOS For time and persuasion and the love of pleasure may enchant a man into a change of purpose, and the force of grief and pain may compel him. EOS And therefore our guardians must be men who have been tried by many tests, like gold in the refiner's fire, and have been passed first through danger, then through pleasure, and at every age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain, in full command of themselves and their principles; having all their faculties in harmonious exercise for their country's good. EOS These shall receive the highest honours both in life and death. EOS (It would perhaps be better to confine the term 'guardians' to this select class: the younger men may be called 'auxiliaries.') EOS And now for one magnificent lie, in the belief of which, Oh that we could train our rulers!--at any rate let us make the attempt with the rest of the world. EOS 'I do not wonder at your being ashamed to propound such a fiction.' EOS But as they are all sprung from a common stock, a golden parent may have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden son, and then there must be a change of rank; the son of the rich must descend, and the child of the artisan rise, in the social scale; for an oracle says 'that the State will come to an end if governed by a man of brass or iron.' EOS Will our citizens ever believe all this? EOS 'Not in the present generation, but in the next, perhaps, Yes.' EOS Their habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education. EOS They should have no property; their pay should only meet their expenses; and they should have common meals. EOS Gold and silver we will tell them that they have from God, and this divine gift in their souls they must not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name of gold. EOS Should they ever acquire houses or lands or money of their own, they will become householders and tradesmen instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of helpers, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and the rest of the State, will be at hand. EOS The constant appeal to the authority of Homer, whom, with grave irony, Plato, after the manner of his age, summons as a witness about ethics and psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting to distinguish the better lesson from the worse, sometimes altering the text from design; more than once quoting or alluding to Homer inaccurately, after the manner of the early logographers turning the Iliad into prose, and delighting to draw far-fetched inferences from his words, or to make ludicrous applications of them. EOS ), but uses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth; not on a system like Theagenes of Rhegium or Metrodorus, or in later times the Stoics, but as fancy may dictate. EOS And the conclusions drawn from them are sound, although the premises are fictitious. EOS These fanciful appeals to Homer add a charm to Plato's style, and at the same time they have the effect of a satire on the follies of Homeric interpretation. EOS To us (and probably to himself), although they take the form of arguments, they are really figures of speech. EOS They may be compared with modern citations from Scripture, which have often a great rhetorical power even when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of. EOS 'The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.' EOS Notwithstanding the fascination which the word 'classical' exercises over us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the Greek poetry which has come down to us. EOS Only perhaps in Sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the two; in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a Greek statue, in which there is nothing to add or to take away; at least this is true of single plays or of large portions of them. EOS Many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind, and he had no power of disengaging or arranging them. EOS For there is a subtle influence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to poetry, just as the music and perfection of language are infused by poetry into prose. EOS In all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his own meaning (Apol. EOS ); for he does not see that the word which is full of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of another; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to others. EOS As if there could be poetry without beauty, or beauty without ease and clearness. EOS The obscurities of early Greek poets arose necessarily out of the state of language and logic which existed in their age. EOS They are not examples to be followed by us; for the use of language ought in every generation to become clearer and clearer. EOS Like Shakespere, they were great in spite, not in consequence, of their imperfections of expression. EOS But there is no reason for returning to the necessary obscurity which prevailed in the infancy of literature. EOS The English poets of the last century were certainly not obscure; and we have no excuse for losing what they had gained, or for going back to the earlier or transitional age which preceded them. EOS In the third book of the Republic a nearer approach is made to a theory of art than anywhere else in Plato. EOS His views may be summed up as follows:--True art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and ideal,--the expression of the highest moral energy, whether in action or repose. EOS To live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and simple character, or to listen to such strains, is the best of influences,--the true Greek atmosphere, in which youth should be brought up. EOS That is the way to create in them a natural good taste, which will have a feeling of truth and beauty in all things. EOS There is hardly any mention in Plato of the creative arts; only in two or three passages does he even allude to them (Rep.; Soph.). EOS He is not lost in rapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the Propylea, the statues of Zeus or Athene. EOS Yet it is hard to suppose that some influence, such as he hopes to inspire in youth, did not pass into his own mind from the works of art which he saw around him. EOS We are living upon the fragments of them, and find in a few broken stones the standard of truth and beauty. EOS But in Plato this feeling has no expression; he nowhere says that beauty is the object of art; he seems to deny that wisdom can take an external form (Phaedrus); he does not distinguish the fine from the mechanical arts. EOS Mem. EOS ; and Sophist). EOS Plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better not be in robust health; and should have known what illness is in his own person. EOS But the judge ought to have had no similar experience of evil; he is to be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence, became acquainted late in life with the vices of others. EOS And therefore, according to Plato, a judge should not be young, just as a young man according to Aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy. EOS The bad, on the other hand, have a knowledge of vice, but no knowledge of virtue. EOS It may be doubted, however, whether this train of reflection is well founded. EOS There is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight into vice. EOS 5. EOS One of the most remarkable conceptions of Plato, because un-Greek and also very different from anything which existed at all in his age of the world, is the transposition of ranks. EOS And in the ancient Greek aristocracies, merit was certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was based. EOS And although the existence of an ideal aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains of early Greek history, and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a character, however the idea may be defined, to any actual Hellenic state--or indeed to any state which has ever existed in the world--still the rule of the best was certainly the aspiration of philosophers, who probably accommodated a good deal their views of primitive history to their own notions of good government. EOS Plato further insists on applying to the guardians of his state a series of tests by which all those who fell short of a fixed standard were either removed from the governing body, or not admitted to it; and this 'academic' discipline did to a certain extent prevail in Greek states, especially in Sparta. EOS He also indicates that the system of caste, which existed in a great part of the ancient, and is by no means extinct in the modern European world, should be set aside from time to time in favour of merit. EOS He is aware how deeply the greater part of mankind resent any interference with the order of society, and therefore he proposes his novel idea in the form of what he himself calls a 'monstrous fiction.' EOS (Compare the ceremony of preparation for the two 'great waves' in Book v.) Two principles are indicated by him: first, that there is a distinction of ranks dependent on circumstances prior to the individual: second, that this distinction is and ought to be broken through by personal qualities. EOS He adapts mythology like the Homeric poems to the wants of the state, making 'the Phoenician tale' the vehicle of his ideas. EOS Indeed throughout the Republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into the distance. EOS We do not know whether they are to carry arms, and whether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the communistic regulations respecting property and marriage. EOS In the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration, such as we may also observe among certain masters of the art, not unknown to us, at the present day. EOS But it is evident that Plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact. EOS The power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible mind of the Greek is more than we can easily appreciate. EOS And, besides all this, there is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the harmony of soul and body, which is so potently inspired by them. EOS The second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting questions--How far can the mind control the body? EOS Is the relation between them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? EOS Are they two or one, and is either of them the cause of the other? EOS May we not at times drop the opposition between them, and the mode of describing them, which is so familiar to us, and yet hardly conveys any precise meaning, and try to view this composite creature, man, in a more simple manner? EOS Or again, they are reconciled and move together, either unconsciously in the ordinary work of life, or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim, to be attained not without an effort, and for which every thought and nerve are strained. EOS When the mind touches the body through the appetites, we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other. EOS There is a tendency in us which says 'Drink.' EOS There is another which says, 'Do not drink; it is not good for you.' EOS We are disappointed to find that Plato, in the general condemnation which he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day, depreciates the effects of diet. EOS He would like to have diseases of a definite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. EOS He is afraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life. EOS Neither does he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely influence the body than by the control of eating and drinking; or any other action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of the will can be more simple or truly asserted. EOS (1) The affected ignorance of music, which is Plato's way of expressing that he is passing lightly over the subject. EOS (3) The description of the State sometimes as a reality, and then again as a work of imagination only; these are the arts by which he sustains the reader's interest. EOS (4) Connecting links, or the preparation for the entire expulsion of the poets in Book X. EOS You may add, I replied, that they receive no pay but only their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or a mistress. EOS My answer is, that our guardians may or may not be the happiest of men,--I should not be surprised to find in the long-run that they were,--but this is not the aim of our constitution, which was designed for the good of the whole and not of any one part. EOS If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply: 'The eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue as a whole.' EOS 'Now I can well imagine a fool's paradise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple and fine linen, and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand, that they may work a little when they please; and cobblers and all the other classes of a State lose their distinctive character. EOS And a State may get on without cobblers; but when the guardians degenerate into boon companions, then the ruin is complete. EOS Remember that we are not talking of peasants keeping holiday, but of a State in which every man is expected to do his own work. EOS The happiness resides not in this or that class, but in the State as a whole. EOS I have another remark to make:--A middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money enough to buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. EOS And will not the same condition be best for our citizens? EOS There may be a difficulty in fighting against one enemy; against two there will be none. EOS In the first place, the contest will be carried on by trained warriors against well-to-do citizens: and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout opponents at least? EOS Suppose also, that before engaging we send ambassadors to one of the two cities, saying, 'Silver and gold we have not; do you help us and take our share of the spoil;'--who would fight against the lean, wiry dogs, when they might join with them in preying upon the fatted sheep? EOS 'But if many states join their resources, shall we not be in danger?' EOS They are 'states,' but not 'a state'--many in one. EOS But our State, while she remains true to her principles, will be in very deed the mightiest of Hellenic states. EOS The meaning there implied was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and be at one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. EOS But all these things are secondary, if education, which is the great matter, be duly regarded. EOS When the wheel has once been set in motion, the speed is always increasing; and each generation improves upon the preceding, both in physical and moral qualities. EOS The care of the governors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation; alter the songs of a country, Damon says, and you will soon end by altering its laws. EOS The change appears innocent at first, and begins in play; but the evil soon becomes serious, working secretly upon the characters of individuals, then upon social and commercial relations, and lastly upon the institutions of a state; and there is ruin and confusion everywhere. EOS But if education remains in the established form, there will be no danger. EOS A restorative process will be always going on; the spirit of law and order will raise up what has fallen down. EOS Nor will any regulations be needed for the lesser matters of life--rules of deportment or fashions of dress. EOS Like invites like for good or for evil. EOS Education will correct deficiencies and supply the power of self-government. EOS But without education they may patch and mend as they please; they will make no progress, any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by some favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of living. EOS And such states there are which first ordain under penalty of death that no one shall alter the constitution, and then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out of anything; and he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their leader and saviour. EOS But do you not admire their cleverness? EOS 'Nay, some of them are stupid enough to believe what the people tell them.' EOS And when all the world is telling a man that he is six feet high, and he has no measure, how can he believe anything else? EOS But don't get into a passion: to see our statesmen trying their nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the Hydra-like rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. EOS Minute enactments are superfluous in good states, and are useless in bad ones. EOS Only our ancestral deity sitting upon the centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any sense, in an affair of such magnitude. EOS No foreign god shall be supreme in our realms... EOS Here, as Socrates would say, let us 'reflect on' (Greek) what has preceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens, but only of the well-being of the State. EOS They were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. EOS In this pleasant manner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and modern philosophy, touching the relation of duty to happiness, of right to utility. EOS First duty, then happiness, is the natural order of our moral ideas. EOS The utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error, and shows to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected. EOS The greatest happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a life of virtue and goodness. EOS But we seem to be more assured of a law of right than we can be of a divine purpose, that 'all mankind should be saved;' and we infer the one from the other. EOS And the greatest happiness of the individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the ordinary sense of the term, and may be realised in a life of pain, or in a voluntary death. EOS Further, the word 'happiness' has several ambiguities; it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life, happiness subjective or objective, in this world or in another, of ourselves only or of our neighbours and of all men everywhere. EOS By the modern founder of Utilitarianism the self-regarding and disinterested motives of action are included under the same term, although they are commonly opposed by us as benevolence and self-love. EOS It is associated too much with the comforts and conveniences of life; too little with 'the goods of the soul which we desire for their own sake.' EOS In a great trial, or danger, or temptation, or in any great and heroic action, it is scarcely thought of. EOS But though not the first principle, it is the second, which is like unto it, and is often of easier application. EOS For the larger part of human actions are neither right nor wrong, except in so far as they tend to the happiness of mankind (Introd. EOS Right and truth are the highest aims of government as well as of individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because we cannot directly enforce them. EOS They appeal to the better mind of nations; and sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests to resist. EOS And all the higher class of statesmen have in them something of that idealism which Pericles is said to have gathered from the teaching of Anaxagoras. EOS They recognise that the true leader of men must be above the motives of ambition, and that national character is of greater value than material comfort and prosperity. EOS That he was far from excluding the modern principle of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other passages; in which 'the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most honourable', and also 'the most sacred'. EOS We may note  (1) The manner in which the objection of Adeimantus here, is designed to draw out and deepen the argument of Socrates. EOS (2) The conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of politics and of art, in the latter supplying the only principle of criticism, which, under the various names of harmony, symmetry, measure, proportion, unity, the Greek seems to have applied to works of art. EOS (3) The requirement that the State should be limited in size, after the traditional model of a Greek state; as in the Politics of Aristotle, the fact that the cities of Hellas were small is converted into a principle. EOS (5) The light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over when provision has been made for two great principles,--first, that religion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods, secondly, that the true national or Hellenic type shall be maintained...  Socrates proceeds: But where amid all this is justice? EOS Son of Ariston, tell me where. EOS Light a candle and search the city, and get your brother and the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her. EOS Well, I said, I will lead the way, but do you follow. EOS My notion is, that our State being perfect will contain all the four virtues--wisdom, courage, temperance, justice. EOS If we eliminate the three first, the unknown remainder will be justice. EOS First then, of wisdom: the State which we have called into being will be wise because politic. EOS And policy is one among many kinds of skill,--not the skill of the carpenter, or of the worker in metal, or of the husbandman, but the skill of him who advises about the interests of the whole State. EOS Of such a kind is the skill of the guardians, who are a small class in number, far smaller than the blacksmiths; but in them is concentrated the wisdom of the State. EOS Our second virtue is courage, which we have no difficulty in finding in another class--that of soldiers. EOS You know the way in which dyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple or of any other colour. EOS Now the ground is education, and the laws are the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither the soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them out. EOS This power which preserves right opinion about danger I would ask you to call 'courage,' adding the epithet 'political' or 'civilized' in order to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher courage which may hereafter be discussed. EOS Two virtues remain; temperance and justice. EOS More than the preceding virtues temperance suggests the idea of harmony. EOS Some light is thrown upon the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as 'master of himself'--which has an absurd sound, because the master is also the servant. EOS The expression really means that the better principle in a man masters the worse. EOS Now to which of these classes does temperance belong? EOS 'To both of them.' EOS And our State if any will be the abode of temperance; and we were right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused through the whole, making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind, and attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of an instrument, whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom, strength or wealth. EOS And now we are near the spot; let us draw in and surround the cover and watch with all our eyes, lest justice should slip away and escape. EOS Tell me, if you see the thicket move first. EOS 'Nay, I would have you lead.' EOS Well then, offer up a prayer and follow. EOS I begin to see a track. EOS 'Good news.' EOS While we are straining our eyes into the distance, justice is tumbling out at our feet. EOS We are as bad as people looking for a thing which they have in their hands. EOS Have you forgotten our old principle of the division of labour, or of every man doing his own business, concerning which we spoke at the foundation of the State--what but this was justice? EOS Is there any other virtue remaining which can compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in the scale of political virtue? EOS For 'every one having his own' is the great object of government; and the great object of trade is that every man should do his own business. EOS And this evil is injustice, or every man doing another's business. EOS For the definition which we believe to hold good in states has still to be tested by the individual. EOS Having read the large letters we will now come back to the small. EOS Each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the three parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the State, although the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony than the first two. EOS It is obvious and simple, and for that very reason has not been found out. EOS The modern logician will be inclined to object that ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances, but that they run into one another and may be only different aspects or names of the same thing, and such in this instance appears to be the case. EOS And so far from justice remaining over when the other virtues are eliminated, the justice and temperance of the Republic can with difficulty be distinguished. EOS Yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort of harmony, and in this respect is akin to justice. EOS Justice seems to differ from temperance in degree rather than in kind; whereas temperance is the harmony of discordant elements, justice is the perfect order by which all natures and classes do their own business, the right man in the right place, the division and co-operation of all the citizens. EOS Justice, again, is a more abstract notion than the other virtues, and therefore, from Plato's point of view, the foundation of them, to which they are referred and which in idea precedes them. EOS The proposal to omit temperance is a mere trick of style intended to avoid monotony. EOS There is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier Dialogues of Plato (Protagoras; Arist. EOS This receives an answer which is to the effect that there are four cardinal virtues (now for the first time brought together in ethical philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like Aristotle's conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others, but the whole of virtue relative to the parts. EOS ...Socrates is now going to identify the individual and the State. EOS But first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul. EOS The word 'just,' whether applied to the individual or to the State, has the same meaning. EOS And the term 'justice' implied that the same three principles in the State and in the individual were doing their own business. EOS But are they really three or one? EOS The question is difficult, and one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now using; but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time. EOS 'The shorter will satisfy me.' EOS The Scythians and Thracians are passionate, our own race intellectual, and the Egyptians and Phoenicians covetous, because the individual members of each have such and such a character; the difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or three; whether, that is to say, we reason with one part of our nature, desire with another, are angry with another, or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action. EOS This enquiry, however, requires a very exact definition of terms. EOS There is no necessity to mention all the possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume that opposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation. EOS And to the class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and avoidance. EOS When relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives have no attributes; when they have attributes, their correlatives also have them. EOS For example, the term 'greater' is simply relative to 'less,' and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. EOS Again, every science has a distinct character, which is defined by an object; medicine, for example, is the science of health, although not to be confounded with health. EOS Having cleared our ideas thus far, let us return to the original instance of thirst, which has a definite object--drink. EOS The two impulses are contradictory; and therefore we may assume that they spring from distinct principles in the soul. EOS But is passion a third principle, or akin to desire? EOS He was coming up from the Piraeus outside the north wall, and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying by the executioner. EOS He felt a longing desire to see them and also an abhorrence of them; at first he turned away and shut his eyes, then, suddenly tearing them open, he said,--'Take your fill, ye wretches, of the fair sight.' EOS Now is there not here a third principle which is often found to come to the assistance of reason against desire, but never of desire against reason? EOS This shows that passion is the ally of reason. EOS Is passion then the same with reason? EOS No, for the former exists in children and brutes; and Homer affords a proof of the distinction between them when he says, 'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul.' EOS And now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer that the virtues of the State and of the individual are the same. EOS Each of the three classes will do the work of its own class in the State, and each part in the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion, the inferior, will be harmonized by the influence of music and gymnastic. EOS The wisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which has authority and reason. EOS The virtue of temperance is the friendship of the ruling and the subject principles, both in the State and in the individual. EOS Of justice we have already spoken; and the notion already given of it may be confirmed by common instances. EOS Will the just state or the just individual steal, lie, commit adultery, or be guilty of impiety to gods and men? EOS 'No.' EOS And justice is the quality which makes just men and just states. EOS And injustice, which is the insubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul, is the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to the soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the body, good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. EOS And virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice is the disease and weakness and deformity of the soul. EOS Again the old question returns upon us: Is justice or injustice the more profitable? EOS For injustice, like mortal disease, makes life not worth having. EOS Thus there are five forms in all, both of states and of souls... EOS In attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties, Plato takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. EOS And the criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the faculties. EOS This leads him into a tiresome digression, which is intended to explain the nature of contradiction. EOS First, the contradiction must be at the same time and in the same relation. EOS Secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced into either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is expressed: for example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. EOS He implies, what he does not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by the impulse of anger, a man is restrained from drinking, this proves that thirst, or desire under which thirst is included, is distinct from anger and reason. EOS And still there remains an exception to the rule in the use of the term 'good,' which is always implied in the object of desire. EOS The chief difficulty in this early analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the irascible faculty (Greek), which may be variously described under the terms righteous indignation, spirit, passion. EOS It is the foundation of courage, which includes in Plato moral courage, the courage of enduring pain, and of surmounting intellectual difficulties, as well as of meeting dangers in war. EOS Though irrational, it inclines to side with the rational: it cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted: it sometimes takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the performance of great actions. EOS It is the 'lion heart' with which the reason makes a treaty. EOS On the other hand it is negative rather than positive; it is indignant at wrong or falsehood, but does not, like Love in the Symposium and Phaedrus, aspire to the vision of Truth or Good. EOS It is the peremptory military spirit which prevails in the government of honour. EOS Although Aristotle has retained the word, yet we may observe that 'passion' (Greek) has with him lost its affinity to the rational and has become indistinguishable from 'anger' (Greek). EOS By modern philosophy too, as well as in our ordinary conversation, the words anger or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense; there is no connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are aroused. EOS The words 'as healthy practices (Greek) produce health, so do just practices produce justice,' have a sound very like the Nicomachean Ethics. EOS But we note also that an incidental remark in Plato has become a far-reaching principle in Aristotle, and an inseparable part of a great Ethical system. EOS There is a difficulty in understanding what Plato meant by 'the longer way': he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not be satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction. EOS In the sixth and seventh books (compare Sophist and Parmenides) he has given us a sketch of such a metaphysic; but when Glaucon asks for the final revelation of the idea of good, he is put off with the declaration that he has not yet studied the preliminary sciences. EOS Perhaps he hoped to find some a priori method of developing the parts out of the whole; or he might have asked which of the ideas contains the other ideas, and possibly have stumbled on the Hegelian identity of the 'ego' and the 'universal.' EOS Or he may have imagined that ideas might be constructed in some manner analogous to the construction of figures and numbers in the mathematical sciences. EOS The aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits of human thought and language: they seem to have reached a height at which they are 'moving about in worlds unrealized,' and their conceptions, although profoundly affecting their own minds, become invisible or unintelligible to others. EOS We are not therefore surprized to find that Plato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine of ideas; or that his school in a later generation, like his contemporaries Glaucon and Adeimantus, were unable to follow him in this region of speculation. EOS 'Because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting women and children, of whom you have slily disposed under the general formula that friends have all things in common.' EOS And was I not right? EOS 'Yes,' he replied, 'but there are many sorts of communism or community, and we want to know which of them is right. EOS The company, as you have just heard, are resolved to have a further explanation.' EOS Thrasymachus said, 'Do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold, or to hear you discourse?' EOS Yes, I said; but the discourse should be of a reasonable length. EOS 'Fear not,' he replied, 'for you are speaking among friends.' EOS Not that I mind a little innocent laughter; but he who kills the truth is a murderer. EOS 'Then,' said Glaucon, laughing, 'in case you should murder us we will acquit you beforehand, and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiving us.' EOS Now dogs are not divided into hes and shes--we do not take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home to look after their puppies. EOS They have the same employments--the only difference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other weaker. EOS But if women are to have the same employments as men, they must have the same education--they must be taught music and gymnastics, and the art of war. EOS I know that a great joke will be made of their riding on horseback and carrying weapons; the sight of the naked old wrinkled women showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a vision of beauty, and may be expected to become a famous jest. EOS But we must not mind the wits; there was a time when they might have laughed at our present gymnastics. EOS Evil only should be the subject of ridicule. EOS The first question is, whether women are able either wholly or partially to share in the employments of men. EOS And here we may be charged with inconsistency in making the proposal at all. EOS But is there no difference between men and women? EOS Nay, are they not wholly different? EOS However, when a man is out of his depth, whether in a pool or in an ocean, he can only swim for his life; and we must try to find a way of escape, if we can. EOS But this is only a verbal opposition. EOS Simply because the opposition between them is partial only, like the difference between a male physician and a female physician, not running through the whole nature, like the difference between a physician and a carpenter. EOS And if the difference of the sexes is only that the one beget and the other bear children, this does not prove that they ought to have distinct educations. EOS Admitting that women differ from men in capacity, do not men equally differ from one another? EOS Has not nature scattered all the qualities which our citizens require indifferently up and down among the two sexes? EOS and even in their peculiar pursuits, are not women often, though in some cases superior to men, ridiculously enough surpassed by them? EOS Women are the same in kind as men, and have the same aptitude or want of aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war, but in a less degree. EOS One woman will be a good guardian, another not; and the good must be chosen to be the colleagues of our guardians. EOS And the education which we give them will be the very best, far superior to that of cobblers, and will train up the very best women, and nothing can be more advantageous to the State than this. EOS Therefore let them strip, clothed in their chastity, and share in the toils of war and in the defence of their country; he who laughs at them is a fool for his pains. EOS The first wave is past, and the argument is compelled to admit that men and women have common duties and pursuits. EOS A second and greater wave is rolling in--community of wives and children; is this either expedient or possible? EOS The expediency I do not doubt; I am not so sure of the possibility. EOS In the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones where they are wanted, and their allies or ministers will obey. EOS But they cannot be allowed to live in licentiousness; that is an unholy thing, which the rulers are determined to prevent. EOS 'Certainly.' EOS But then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the State, for they will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desirable unions between their subjects. EOS The good must be paired with the good, and the bad with the bad, and the offspring of the one must be reared, and of the other destroyed; in this way the flock will be preserved in prime condition. EOS And when children are born, the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried to an enclosure in a certain part of the city, and there attended by suitable nurses; the rest will be hurried away to places unknown. EOS The mothers will be brought to the fold and will suckle the children; care however must be taken that none of them recognise their own offspring; and if necessary other nurses may also be hired. EOS 'Then the wives of our guardians will have a fine easy time when they are having children.' EOS Any one above or below those ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety; also every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without the consent of the rulers. EOS 'But how shall we know the degrees of affinity, when all things are common?' EOS The answer is, that brothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months after the espousals, and their parents those who are then espoused, and every one will have many children and every child many parents. EOS Socrates proceeds: I have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous and also consistent with our entire polity. EOS The greatest good of a State is unity; the greatest evil, discord and distraction. EOS And there will be unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or interests--where if one member suffers all the members suffer, if one citizen is touched all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the little finger of the State runs through the whole body and vibrates to the soul. EOS For the true State, like an individual, is injured as a whole when any part is affected. EOS Every State has subjects and rulers, who in a democracy are called rulers, and in other States masters: but in our State they are called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in other States are termed slaves, are by us termed nurturers and paymasters, and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other places, are by us called fathers and brothers. EOS Can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend himself? EOS The permission to strike when insulted will be an 'antidote' to the knife and will prevent disturbances in the State. EOS Moreover, our citizens will be rid of the lesser evils of life; there will be no flattery of the rich, no sordid household cares, no borrowing and not paying. EOS At the same time, if any conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to himself, he must be reminded that 'half is better than the whole.' EOS 'I should certainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of such a brave life.' EOS But is such a community possible?--as among the animals, so also among men; and if possible, in what way possible? EOS About war there is no difficulty; the principle of communism is adapted to military service. EOS Parents will take their children to look on at a battle, just as potters' boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel. EOS Young warriors must learn, but they must not run into danger, although a certain degree of risk is worth incurring when the benefit is great. EOS Cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen; gentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners, may be presented to the enemy. EOS First of all he shall be crowned by all the youths in the army; secondly, he shall receive the right hand of fellowship; and thirdly, do you think that there is any harm in his being kissed? EOS We have already determined that he shall have more wives than others, in order that he may have as many children as possible. EOS And at a feast he shall have more to eat; we have the authority of Homer for honouring brave men with 'long chines,' which is an appropriate compliment, because meat is a very strengthening thing. EOS Fill the bowl then, and give the best seats and meats to the brave--may they do them good! EOS And he who dies in battle will be at once declared to be of the golden race, and will, as we believe, become one of Hesiod's guardian angels. EOS Shall Hellenes be enslaved? EOS Certainly not; for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking, and has been the ruin of many an army. EOS There is meanness and feminine malice in making an enemy of the dead body, when the soul which was the owner has fled--like a dog who cannot reach his assailants, and quarrels with the stones which are thrown at him instead. EOS And on similar grounds there should be a limit to the devastation of Hellenic territory--the houses should not be burnt, nor more than the annual produce carried off. EOS For war is of two kinds, civil and foreign; the first of which is properly termed 'discord,' and only the second 'war;' and war between Hellenes is in reality civil war--a quarrel in a family, which is ever to be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural, and ought to be prosecuted with a view to reconciliation in a true phil-Hellenic spirit, as of those who would chasten but not utterly enslave. EOS That is the way in which Hellenes should war against one another--and against barbarians, as they war against one another now. EOS 'But, my dear Socrates, you are forgetting the main question: Is such a State possible? EOS I grant all and more than you say about the blessedness of being one family--fathers, brothers, mothers, daughters, going out to war together; but I want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal State.' EOS You are too unmerciful. EOS The first wave and the second wave I have hardly escaped, and now you will certainly drown me with the third. EOS 'Not a whit.' EOS Is this ideal at all the worse for being impracticable? EOS Can any reality come up to the idea? EOS Nature will not allow words to be fully realized; but if I am to try and realize the ideal of the State in a measure, I think that an approach may be made to the perfection of which I dream by one or two, I do not say slight, but possible changes in the present constitution of States. EOS Until, then, kings are philosophers, or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill: no, nor the human race; nor will our ideal polity ever come into being. EOS I know that this is a hard saying, which few will be able to receive. EOS You got me into the scrape, I said. EOS 'And I was right,' he replied; 'however, I will stand by you as a sort of do-nothing, well-meaning ally.' EOS As you are a man of pleasure, you will not have forgotten how indiscriminate lovers are in their attachments; they love all, and turn blemishes into beauties. EOS Lovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their affection in every form. EOS Now here comes the point:--The philosopher too is a lover of knowledge in every form; he has an insatiable curiosity. EOS They are not true philosophers, but only an imitation. EOS Those who recognize these realities are philosophers; whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours, and understand their use in the arts, but cannot attain to the true or waking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the light of knowledge, but of opinion, and what they see is a dream only. EOS Perhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us; can we pacify him without revealing the disorder of his mind? EOS Suppose we say that, if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion only. EOS This intermediate or contingent matter is and is not at the same time, and partakes both of existence and of non-existence. EOS And he who grovels in the world of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is not a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only... EOS The fifth book is the new beginning of the Republic, in which the community of property and of family are first maintained, and the transition is made to the kingdom of philosophers. EOS For both of these Plato, after his manner, has been preparing in some chance words of Book IV, which fall unperceived on the reader's mind, as they are supposed at first to have fallen on the ear of Glaucon and Adeimantus. EOS The 'paradoxes,' as Morgenstern terms them, of this book of the Republic will be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the style, and some explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added. EOS ; or the reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous, when Glaucon describes the manner in which the new truth will be received by mankind. EOS It is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal festival may marry one of its own brothers or sisters, or even one of its parents, at another. EOS If it were worth while to argue seriously about such fancies, we might remark that while all the old affinities are abolished, the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural or rational principle, but only upon the accident of children having been born in the same month and year. EOS The singular expression which is employed to describe the age of five-and-twenty may perhaps be taken from some poet. EOS In the delineation of the philosopher, the illustrations of the nature of philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of Glaucon, the Athenian man of pleasure, than to modern tastes or feelings. EOS They are partly facetious, but also contain a germ of truth. EOS That science is a whole, remains a true principle of inductive as well as of metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is still the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in ancient times. EOS At the end of the fifth book Plato introduces the figment of contingent matter, which has exercised so great an influence both on the Ethics and Theology of the modern world, and which occurs here for the first time in the history of philosophy. EOS He did not remark that the degrees of knowledge in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the object. EOS With him a word must answer to an idea; and he could not conceive of an opinion which was an opinion about nothing. EOS The influence of analogy led him to invent 'parallels and conjugates' and to overlook facts. EOS To us some of his difficulties are puzzling only from their simplicity: we do not perceive that the answer to them 'is tumbling out at our feet.' EOS To the mind of early thinkers, the conception of not-being was dark and mysterious; they did not see that this terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge was only a logical determination. EOS Thus through the ambiguity of (Greek) Plato, attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of human thought, seems to have confused perception and opinion, and to have failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative. EOS In the Theaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up; in the Sophist the second; and for this, as well as for other reasons, both these dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the Republic. EOS BOOK VI. EOS Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty, truth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask whether they or the many shall be rulers in our State. EOS But who can doubt that philosophers should be chosen, if they have the other qualities which are required in a ruler? EOS For they are lovers of the knowledge of the eternal and of all truth; they are haters of falsehood; their meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of knowledge; they are spectators of all time and all existence; and in the magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing to them, nor is death fearful. EOS Also they are of a social, gracious disposition, equally free from cowardice and arrogance. EOS They learn and remember easily; they have harmonious, well-regulated minds; truth flows to them sweetly by nature. EOS Can the god of Jealousy himself find any fault with such an assemblage of good qualities? EOS Here Adeimantus interposes:--'No man can answer you, Socrates; but every man feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument. EOS He is driven from one position to another, until he has nothing more to say, just as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by a more skilled opponent. EOS And yet all the time he may be right. EOS I should say that he is quite right. EOS 'Then how is such an admission reconcileable with the doctrine that philosophers should be kings?' EOS The relation of good men to their governments is so peculiar, that in order to defend them I must take an illustration from the world of fiction. EOS The sailors want to steer, although they know nothing of the art; and they have a theory that it cannot be learned. EOS If the helm is refused them, they drug the captain's posset, bind him hand and foot, and take possession of the ship. EOS This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpret for me to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name, and to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use him, are to blame for his uselessness. EOS The wise man should not seek the rich, as the proverb bids, but every man, whether rich or poor, must knock at the door of the physician when he has need of him. EOS Not that these are the worst enemies of philosophy, who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons when they are corrupted by the world. EOS Did we not say of him just now, that he loved truth and hated falsehood, and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of phenomena, but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to the contemplation of the absolute? EOS All the virtues as well as truth, who is the leader of them, took up their abode in his soul. EOS But as you were observing, if we turn aside to view the reality, we see that the persons who were thus described, with the exception of a small and useless class, are utter rogues. EOS Every one will admit that the philosopher, in our description of him, is a rare being. EOS There is no good thing which may not be a cause of evil--health, wealth, strength, rank, and the virtues themselves, when placed under unfavourable circumstances. EOS For as in the animal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the accompaniment of good air and soil, so the best of human characters turn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil; whereas weak natures hardly ever do any considerable good or harm; they are not the stuff out of which either great criminals or great heroes are made. EOS Some persons say that the Sophists are the corrupters of youth; but is not public opinion the real Sophist who is everywhere present--in those very persons, in the assembly, in the courts, in the camp, in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re-echoed by the surrounding hills? EOS and will any education save him from being carried away by the torrent? EOS Nor is this all. EOS What principle of rival Sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an unequal contest? EOS Further, I would have you consider that the hireling Sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who knows how to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts. EOS Good is what pleases him, evil what he dislikes; truth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute. EOS Such is the Sophist's wisdom, and such is the condition of those who make public opinion the test of truth, whether in art or in morals. EOS The curse is laid upon them of being and doing what it approves, and when they attempt first principles the failure is ludicrous. EOS And the world if not a believer in the idea cannot be a philosopher, and must therefore be a persecutor of philosophers. EOS If at this instant a friend whispers to him, 'Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be educated--do you think that he will listen? EOS Or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted towards philosophy, will they not make Herculean efforts to spoil and corrupt him? EOS Are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge, no less than riches, may divert him? EOS A clever mechanic having a soul coarse as his body, thinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor. EOS For philosophy, even in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her own--and he, like a bald little blacksmith's apprentice as he is, having made some money and got out of durance, washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom and marries his master's daughter. EOS 'They will.' EOS And these few when they have tasted the pleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at that den of thieves and place of wild beasts, which is human life, will stand aside from the storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to preserve their own innocence and to depart in peace. EOS 'A great work, too, will have been accomplished by them.' EOS Great, yes, but not the greatest; for man is a social being, and can only attain his highest development in the society which is best suited to him. EOS Enough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name. EOS Not one of them; at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in a strange soil; only in her proper state will she be shown to be of heavenly growth. EOS 'And is her proper state ours or some other?' EOS Ours in all points but one, which was left undetermined. EOS But we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty, and now the question recurs and has not grown easier:--How may philosophy be safely studied? EOS In the first place, I say boldly that nothing can be worse than the present mode of study. EOS Persons usually pick up a little philosophy in early youth, and in the intervals of business, but they never master the real difficulty, which is dialectic. EOS Later, perhaps, they occasionally go to a lecture on philosophy. EOS Years advance, and the sun of philosophy, unlike that of Heracleitus, sets never to rise again. EOS Then, when active life is over, let him finally return to philosophy. EOS And I shall do my best to convince him and all mankind of the truth of my words, or at any rate to prepare for the future when, in another life, we may again take part in similar discussions. EOS 'That will be a long time hence.' EOS Not long in comparison with eternity. EOS The many will probably remain incredulous, for they have never seen the natural unity of ideas, but only artificial juxtapositions; not free and generous thoughts, but tricks of controversy and quips of law;--a perfect man ruling in a perfect state, even a single one they have not known. EOS And we foresaw that there was no chance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity was laid upon philosophers--not the rogues, but those whom we called the useless class--of holding office; or until the sons of kings were inspired with a true love of philosophy. EOS Whether in the infinity of past time there has been, or is in some distant land, or ever will be hereafter, an ideal such as we have described, we stoutly maintain that there has been, is, and will be such a state whenever the Muse of philosophy rules. EOS Will you say that the world is of another mind? EOS O, my friend, do not revile the world! EOS They will soon change their opinion if they are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the philosopher. EOS Consider, again, that the many hate not the true but the false philosophers--the pretenders who force their way in without invitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles, which is unlike the spirit of philosophy. EOS For the true philosopher despises earthly strife; his eye is fixed on the eternal order in accordance with which he moulds himself into the Divine image (and not himself only, but other men), and is the creator of the virtues private as well as public. EOS 'Certainly not. EOS But what will be the process of delineation?' EOS The artist will do nothing until he has made a tabula rasa; on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state, glancing often at the divine truth of nature, and from that deriving the godlike among men, mingling the two elements, rubbing out and painting in, until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine and human. EOS But perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an artist. EOS What will they doubt? EOS That the philosopher is a lover of truth, having a nature akin to the best?--and if they admit this will they still quarrel with us for making philosophers our kings? EOS Let us assume then that they are pacified. EOS Still, a person may hesitate about the probability of the son of a king being a philosopher. EOS And we do not deny that they are very liable to be corrupted; but yet surely in the course of ages there might be one exception--and one is enough. EOS If one son of a king were a philosopher, and had obedient citizens, he might bring the ideal polity into being. EOS Hence we conclude that our laws are not only the best, but that they are also possible, though not free from difficulty. EOS But at this point, the argument put on her veil and turned into another path. EOS I hesitated to make the assertion which I now hazard,--that our guardians must be philosophers. EOS Intelligence and spirit are not often combined with steadiness; the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to intellectual toil. EOS And yet these opposite elements are all necessary, and therefore, as we were saying before, the aspirant must be tested in pleasures and dangers; and also, as we must now further add, in the highest branches of knowledge. EOS You will remember, that when we spoke of the virtues mention was made of a longer road, which you were satisfied to leave unexplored. EOS 'Enough seemed to have been said.' EOS Of all men the guardian must not faint in the search after truth; he must be prepared to take the longer road, or he will never reach that higher region which is above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must not only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision. EOS 'And what are the highest?' EOS Some people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this involves a circle,--the good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with the good. EOS 'But, Socrates, what is this supreme principle, knowledge or pleasure, or what? EOS You may think me troublesome, but I say that you have no business to be always repeating the doctrines of others instead of giving us your own.' EOS 'You may offer an opinion.' EOS And will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science? EOS 'I will only ask you to give such an explanation of the good as you have given already of temperance and justice.' EOS To the parent or principal I cannot introduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which I may compare with the interest on the principal, I will. EOS (Audit the account, and do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.) EOS You remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful, the particular and the universal, the objects of sight and the objects of thought? EOS For light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye of man. EOS When the sun shines the eye sees, and in the intellectual world where truth is, there is sight and light. EOS Now that which is the sun of intelligent natures, is the idea of good, the cause of knowledge and truth, yet other and fairer than they are, and standing in the same relation to them in which the sun stands to light. EOS O inconceivable height of beauty, which is above knowledge and above truth! EOS ('You cannot surely mean pleasure,' he said. EOS And this idea of good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and the author not of knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than either in dignity and power. EOS There is, I said; and bearing in mind our two suns or principles, imagine further their corresponding worlds--one of the visible, the other of the intelligible; you may assist your fancy by figuring the distinction under the image of a line divided into two unequal parts, and may again subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere. EOS The sphere of the intelligible will also have two divisions,--one of mathematics, in which there is no ascent but all is descent; no inquiring into premises, but only drawing of inferences. EOS In this division the mind works with figures and numbers, the images of which are taken not from the shadows, but from the objects, although the truth of them is seen only with the mind's eye; and they are used as hypotheses without being analysed. EOS 'I partly understand,' he replied; 'you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical, metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences, whichever is to be the name of them; and the latter conceptions you refuse to make subjects of pure intellect, because they have no first principle, although when resting on a first principle, they pass into the higher sphere.' EOS You understand me very well, I said. EOS He has the noblest gifts of nature, and makes the highest use of them. EOS None of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life. EOS There is no part of truth, whether great or small, which he will dishonour; and in the least things he will discern the greatest (Parmen.). EOS Like the ancient philosopher he sees the world pervaded by analogies, but he can also tell 'why in some cases a single instance is sufficient for an induction' (Mill's Logic), while in other cases a thousand examples would prove nothing. EOS He inquires into a portion of knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be embraced by a single mind or life. EOS Like Plato, he has a vision of the unity of knowledge, not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study of elementary mathematics, but as the far-off result of the working of many minds in many ages. EOS He too must have a nobility of character, without which genius loses the better half of greatness. EOS Regarding the world as a point in immensity, and each individual as a link in a never-ending chain of existence, he will not think much of his own life, or be greatly afraid of death. EOS Adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the Socratic reasoning, thus showing that Plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method. EOS In a long argument words are apt to change their meaning slightly, or premises may be assumed or conclusions inferred with rather too much certainty or universality; the variation at each step may be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes considerable. EOS Hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or algebraic formulae to logic. EOS The imperfection, or rather the higher and more elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the precision of numbers or of symbols. EOS And here, as elsewhere, Plato seems to intimate that the time had come when the negative and interrogative method of Socrates must be superseded by a positive and constructive one, of which examples are given in some of the later dialogues. EOS Contrary to all expectation Socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of this, and explains the anomaly in an allegory, first characteristically depreciating his own inventive powers. EOS The uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that mankind will not use them. EOS Concerning the false philosopher, Socrates argues that the best is most liable to corruption; and that the finer nature is more likely to suffer from alien conditions. EOS An Alcibiades, a Mirabeau, or a Napoleon the First, are born either to be the authors of great evils in states, or 'of great good, when they are drawn in that direction.' EOS The alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may be the elements of culture to another. EOS In general a man can only receive his highest development in a congenial state or family, among friends or fellow-workers. EOS But also he may sometimes be stirred by adverse circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them and reforms them. EOS And while weaker or coarser characters will extract good out of evil, say in a corrupt state of the church or of society, and live on happily, allowing the evil to remain, the finer or stronger natures may be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences--may become misanthrope and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the founders of the monastic orders, or the Reformers, owing to some peculiarity in themselves or in their age, may break away entirely from the world and from the church, sometimes into great good, sometimes into great evil, sometimes into both. EOS And the same holds in the lesser sphere of a convent, a school, a family. EOS Plato would have us consider how easily the best natures are overpowered by public opinion, and what efforts the rest of mankind will make to get possession of them. EOS The world, the church, their own profession, any political or party organization, are always carrying them off their legs and teaching them to apply high and holy names to their own prejudices and interests. EOS The 'monster' corporation to which they belong judges right and truth to be the pleasure of the community. EOS The individual becomes one with his order; or, if he resists, the world is too much for him, and will sooner or later be revenged on him. EOS This is, perhaps, a one-sided but not wholly untrue picture of the maxims and practice of mankind when they 'sit down together at an assembly,' either in ancient or modern times. EOS When the higher natures are corrupted by politics, the lower take possession of the vacant place of philosophy. EOS This is described in one of those continuous images in which the argument, to use a Platonic expression, 'veils herself,' and which is dropped and reappears at intervals. EOS And yet there is also a better mind of the many; they would believe if they were taught. EOS But hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation of philosophy, words without thoughts, systems which have no life in them; a (divine) person uttering the words of beauty and freedom, the friend of man holding communion with the Eternal, and seeking to frame the state in that image, they have never known. EOS The first thought is that the people are the enemies of truth and right; the second, that this only arises out of an accidental error and confusion, and that they do not really hate those who love them, if they could be educated to know them. EOS In the latter part of the sixth book, three questions have to be considered: 1st, the nature of the longer and more circuitous way, which is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of Book IV; 2nd, the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation of the divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding faculties of the soul:  1. EOS Neither here nor in the Phaedrus or Symposium, nor yet in the Philebus or Sophist, does he give any clear explanation of his meaning. EOS This ideal logic is not practised by him in the search after justice, or in the analysis of the parts of the soul; there, like Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics, he argues from experience and the common use of language. EOS Like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times his mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to realize. EOS He supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion in an age when they can hardly be said to exist. EOS In all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in various proportions. EOS The a priori part is that which is derived from the most universal experience of men, or is universally accepted by them; the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more general principles and becomes imperceptibly one with them. EOS But Plato erroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis, and that the method of science can anticipate science. EOS In entertaining such a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at least his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts of Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and even of Bacon himself, in modern philosophy. EOS These 'guesses at truth' were not made at random; they arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first principles in nature which the genius of the Greek, contemplating the expanse of heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the distance. EOS Nor can we deny that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still, and the human mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought, if philosophy had been strictly confined to the results of experience. EOS Plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist will fill in the lineaments of the ideal state. EOS Is this a pattern laid up in heaven, or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with wondering eye? EOS The answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the omission of particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form which experience supplies (Phaedo). EOS As in science, so also in creative art, there is a synthetical as well as an analytical method. EOS There is no difficulty in seeing that Plato's divisions of knowledge are based, first, on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and intellectual which pervades the whole pre-Socratic philosophy; in which is implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient, of the universal and particular. EOS But the age of philosophy in which he lived seemed to require a further distinction;--numbers and figures were beginning to separate from ideas. EOS The world could no longer regard justice as a cube, and was learning to see, though imperfectly, that the abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind. EOS Hence Plato is led to introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme of his philosophy. EOS When divested of metaphor, a straight line or a square has no more to do with right and justice than a crooked line with vice. EOS There is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first term of the series, which is nowhere else mentioned, and has no reference to any other part of his system. EOS Nor indeed does the relation of shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas. EOS The line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity, and is divided into two unequal parts, and subdivided into two more; each lower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding. EOS Of the four faculties, faith in the lower division has an intermediate position (cp. EOS for the use of the word faith or belief, (Greek), Timaeus), contrasting equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows (Greek) and the higher certainty of understanding (Greek) and reason (Greek). EOS The difference between understanding and mind or reason (Greek) is analogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts and the contemplation of the whole. EOS True knowledge is a whole, and is at rest; consistency and universality are the tests of truth. EOS To this self-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed to correspond. EOS But there is a knowledge of the understanding which is incomplete and in motion always, because unable to rest in the subordinate ideas. EOS Those ideas are called both images and hypotheses--images because they are clothed in sense, hypotheses because they are assumptions only, until they are brought into connexion with the idea of good. EOS The general meaning of the passage, 'Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight...And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible...' so far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into the terms of modern philosophy, may be described or explained as follows:--There is a truth, one and self-existent, to which by the help of a ladder let down from above, the human intelligence may ascend. EOS This unity is like the sun in the heavens, the light by which all things are seen, the being by which they are created and sustained. EOS It is the IDEA of good. EOS And the steps of the ladder leading up to this highest or universal existence are the mathematical sciences, which also contain in themselves an element of the universal. EOS These, too, we see in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good. EOS The method of Socrates is hesitating and tentative, awaiting the fuller explanation of the idea of good, and of the nature of dialectic in the seventh book. EOS The allusion to Theages' bridle, and to the internal oracle, or demonic sign, of Socrates, which here, as always in Plato, is only prohibitory; the remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present evil state of the world is due to God only; the reference to a future state of existence, which is unknown to Glaucon in the tenth book, and in which the discussions of Socrates and his disciples would be resumed; the surprise in the answers; the fanciful irony of Socrates, where he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of the philosopher in a figure of speech; the original observation that the Sophists, after all, are only the representatives and not the leaders of public opinion; the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the shower of sleet under a wall; the figure of 'the great beast' followed by the expression of good-will towards the common people who would not have rejected the philosopher if they had known him; the 'right noble thought' that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness; the hesitation of Socrates in returning once more to his well-worn theme of the idea of good; the ludicrous earnestness of Glaucon; the comparison of philosophy to a deserted maiden who marries beneath her--are some of the most interesting characteristics of the sixth book. EOS Yet a few more words may be added, on the old theme, which was so oft discussed in the Socratic circle, of which we, like Glaucon and Adeimantus, would fain, if possible, have a clearer notion. EOS Like them, we are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be revealed to a student of the mathematical sciences, and we are inclined to think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path to any satisfactory goal. EOS For we have learned that differences of quantity cannot pass into differences of quality, and that the mathematical sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere of our higher thoughts, although they may sometimes furnish symbols and expressions of them, and may train the mind in habits of abstraction and self-concentration. EOS The illusion which was natural to an ancient philosopher has ceased to be an illusion to us. EOS But if the process by which we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary, may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction? EOS We remark, first, that in all ages, and especially in primitive philosophy, words such as being, essence, unity, good, have exerted an extraordinary influence over the minds of men. EOS The meagreness or negativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their power. EOS They have become the forms under which all things were comprehended. EOS There was a need or instinct in the human soul which they satisfied; they were not ideas, but gods, and to this new mythology the men of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations of the elder deities. EOS The idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought, which were beginning to take the place of the old mythology. EOS It meant unity, in which all time and all existence were gathered up. EOS To ask whether God was the maker of it, or made by it, would be like asking whether God could be conceived apart from goodness, or goodness apart from God. EOS Ideas of number, order, harmony, development may also be said to enter into it. EOS We have perhaps arrived at the stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is aiming at, better than he did himself. EOS But if he could have been told that this, or some conception of the same kind, but higher than this, was the truth at which he was aiming, and the need which he sought to supply, he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his own thoughts than he himself knew. EOS In translating him into the language of modern thought, we might insensibly lose the spirit of ancient philosophy. EOS It is remarkable that although Plato speaks of the idea of good as the first principle of truth and being, it is nowhere mentioned in his writings except in this passage. EOS Nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of his disciples in a later generation; it was probably unintelligible to them. EOS Nor does the mention of it in Aristotle appear to have any reference to this or any other passage in his extant writings. EOS BOOK VII. EOS And now I will describe in a figure the enlightenment or unenlightenment of our nature:--Imagine human beings living in an underground den which is open towards the light; they have been there from childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see into the den. EOS Behind the wall appear moving figures, who hold in their hands various works of art, and among them images of men and animals, wood and stone, and some of the passers-by are talking and others silent. EOS 'A strange parable,' he said, 'and strange captives.' EOS They are ourselves, I replied; and they see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den; to these they give names, and if we add an echo which returns from the wall, the voices of the passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows. EOS Suppose now that you suddenly turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the real images; will they believe them to be real? EOS Will not their eyes be dazzled, and will they not try to get away from the light to something which they are able to behold without blinking? EOS And suppose further, that they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the excess of light? EOS Some time will pass before they get the habit of perceiving at all; and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the stars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is. EOS Now the cave or den is the world of sight, the fire is the sun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, and in the world of knowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty, but when seen is inferred to be the author of good and right--parent of the lord of light in this world, and of truth and understanding in the other. EOS He who attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he is unwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they behold in them--he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never in their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance. EOS But blindness is of two kinds, and may be caused either by passing out of darkness into light or out of light into darkness, and a man of sense will distinguish between them, and will not laugh equally at both of them, but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will deem blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the puzzled soul looking at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabitants of the den at those who descend from above. EOS Some persons fancy that instruction is like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the faculty of sight was always there, and that the soul only requires to be turned round towards the light. EOS Now if you take such an one, and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul to earth, his intelligence will be turned round, and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends. EOS We must choose out therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and knowledge of the good; but we must not allow them to remain in the region of light; they must be forced down again among the captives in the den to partake of their labours and honours. EOS You must, each of you, take your turn, and become able to use your eyes in the dark, and with a little practice you will see far better than those who quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a dream only, whilst yours is a waking reality. EOS And this will be the salvation of the State. EOS And the only life which is better than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy, which is also the best preparation for the government of a State. EOS The change is effected by philosophy; it is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a soul from night to day, from becoming to being. EOS And what training will draw the soul upwards? EOS Nothing remains to us but that universal or primary science of which all the arts and sciences are partakers, I mean number or calculation. EOS 'Very true.' EOS Then there is something ludicrous about Palamedes in the tragedy, coming in and saying that he had invented number, and had counted the ranks and set them in order. EOS No man should be a soldier who cannot count, and indeed he is hardly to be called a man. EOS I will explain what I mean by the last expression:--Things sensible are of two kinds; the one class invite or stimulate the mind, while in the other the mind acquiesces. EOS Now the stimulating class are the things which suggest contrast and relation. EOS For example, suppose that I hold up to the eyes three fingers--a fore finger, a middle finger, a little finger--the sight equally recognizes all three fingers, but without number cannot further distinguish them. EOS Or again, suppose two objects to be relatively great and small, these ideas of greatness and smallness are supplied not by the sense, but by the mind. EOS And the perception of their contrast or relation quickens and sets in motion the mind, which is puzzled by the confused intimations of sense, and has recourse to number in order to find out whether the things indicated are one or more than one. EOS Number replies that they are two and not one, and are to be distinguished from one another. EOS Again, the sight beholds great and small, but only in a confused chaos, and not until they are distinguished does the question arise of their respective natures; we are thus led on to the distinction between the visible and intelligible. EOS That was what I meant when I spoke of stimulants to the intellect; I was thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception. EOS The idea of unity, for example, like that of a finger, does not arouse thought unless involving some conception of plurality; but when the one is also the opposite of one, the contradiction gives rise to reflection; an example of this is afforded by any object of sight. EOS All number has also an elevating effect; it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of generation to the contemplation of being, having lesser military and retail uses also. EOS Note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening the wits; no other discipline is equally severe, or an equal test of general ability, or equally improving to a stupid person. EOS Let our second branch of education be geometry. EOS 'I can easily see,' replied Glaucon, 'that the skill of the general will be doubled by his knowledge of geometry.' EOS Shall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? EOS 'Very good,' replied Glaucon; 'the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at once for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.' EOS And there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education is not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the soul, which is better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth seen. EOS Now, will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher? EOS or would you prefer to look to yourself only? EOS Then take a step backward, for we are out of order, and insert the third dimension which is of solids, after the second which is of planes, and then you may proceed to solids in motion. EOS But solid geometry is not popular and has not the patronage of the State, nor is the use of it fully recognized; the difficulty is great, and the votaries of the study are conceited and impatient. EOS Still the charm of the pursuit wins upon men, and, if government would lend a little assistance, there might be great progress made. EOS 'Very true,' replied Glaucon; 'but do I understand you now to begin with plane geometry, and to place next geometry of solids, and thirdly, astronomy, or the motion of solids?' EOS No one can fail to see that the contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.' EOS Star-gazing is just looking up at the ceiling--no better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water--he may look up or look down, but there is no science in that. EOS The vision of knowledge of which I speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the mind. EOS Their beauty is like the beauty of figures drawn by the hand of Daedalus or any other great artist, which may be used for illustration, but no mathematician would seek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical relations. EOS How ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the heavens, in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a disturbing element, marring the symmetry of day and night, of months and years, of the sun and stars in their courses. EOS Only by problems can we place astronomy on a truly scientific basis. EOS Let the heavens alone, and exert the intellect. EOS Still, mathematics admit of other applications, as the Pythagoreans say, and we agree. EOS Let us inquire of the Pythagoreans about them, not forgetting that we have an aim higher than theirs, which is the relation of these sciences to the idea of good. EOS The error which pervades astronomy also pervades harmonics. EOS The musicians put their ears in the place of their minds. EOS 'Yes,' replied Glaucon, 'I like to see them laying their ears alongside of their neighbours' faces--some saying, "That's a new note," others declaring that the two notes are the same.' EOS Yes, I said; but you mean the empirics who are always twisting and torturing the strings of the lyre, and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings; I am referring rather to the Pythagorean harmonists, who are almost equally in error. EOS For they investigate only the numbers of the consonances which are heard, and ascend no higher,--of the true numerical harmony which is unheard, and is only to be found in problems, they have not even a conception. EOS All these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable if they are regarded in their natural relations to one another. EOS 'I dare say, Socrates,' said Glaucon; 'but such a study will be an endless business.' EOS I have hardly ever known a mathematician who could reason.' EOS And the royal road out of the cave into the light, and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to contemplate the shadows of reality, not the shadows of an image only--this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by the help of the mathematical sciences, is the elevation of the soul to the contemplation of the highest ideal of being. EOS 'So far, I agree with you. EOS But now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed to the hymn. EOS What, then, is the nature of dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither?' EOS Dear Glaucon, you cannot follow me here. EOS There can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been disciplined in the previous sciences. EOS But that there is a science of absolute truth, which is attained in some way very different from those now practised, I am confident. EOS For all other arts or sciences are relative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are but a dream or hypothesis of true being, and never analyse their own principles. EOS And so we get four names--two for intellect, and two for opinion,--reason or mind, understanding, faith, perception of shadows--which make a proportion-- being:becoming::intellect:opinion--and science:belief::understanding: perception of shadows. EOS Dialectic may be further described as that science which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature, which distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle against all opponents in the cause of good. EOS And would you have the future rulers of your ideal State intelligent beings, or stupid as posts? EOS I dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and the process of selection may be carried a step further:--As before, they must be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but now they must also have natural ability which education will improve; that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil, retentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral virtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of ignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb, and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind. EOS Justice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they will be the saviours of our State; disciples of another sort would only make philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present. EOS Forgive my enthusiasm; I am becoming excited; but when I see her trampled underfoot, I am angry at the authors of her disgrace. EOS 'I did not notice that you were more excited than you ought to have been.' EOS Now do not let us forget another point in the selection of our disciples--that they must be young and not old. EOS Learning should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural bent is detected. EOS As in training them for war, the young dogs should at first only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics are over which during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily exercise, then the education of the soul will become a more serious matter. EOS At twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more promising disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin. EOS But at this point, judging from present experience, there is a danger that dialectic may be the source of many evils. EOS The danger may be illustrated by a parallel case:--Imagine a person who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers, and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious son. EOS He has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and disregarded the flatterers, and now he does the reverse. EOS Presently he finds that imputations are cast upon them; a troublesome querist comes and asks, 'What is the just and good?' EOS or proves that virtue is vice and vice virtue, and his mind becomes unsettled, and he ceases to love, honour, and obey them as he has hitherto done. EOS The case of such speculators is very pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years' old pupils may not require this pity, let us take every possible care that young persons do not study philosophy too early. EOS For a young man is a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned into and out of his opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings himself and philosophy into discredit. EOS What time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of the soul?--say, twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen years let the student go down into the den, and command armies, and gain experience of life. EOS At fifty let him return to the end of all things, and have his eyes uplifted to the idea of good, and order his life after that pattern; if necessary, taking his turn at the helm of State, and training up others to be his successors. EOS When his time comes he shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest. EOS He shall be honoured with sacrifices, and receive such worship as the Pythian oracle approves. EOS 'You are a statuary, Socrates, and have made a perfect image of our governors.' EOS Yes, and of our governesses, for the women will share in all things with the men. EOS And you will admit that our State is not a mere aspiration, but may really come into being when there shall arise philosopher-kings, one or more, who will despise earthly vanities, and will be the servants of justice only. EOS 'And how will they begin their work?' EOS At the commencement of Book VII, under the figure of a cave having an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light, he returns to view the divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly, as in a picture, the result which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought in the previous discussion; at the same time casting a glance onward at the dialectical process, which is represented by the way leading from darkness to light. EOS The shadows, the images, the reflection of the sun and stars in the water, the stars and sun themselves, severally correspond,--the first, to the realm of fancy and poetry,--the second, to the world of sense,--the third, to the abstractions or universals of sense, of which the mathematical sciences furnish the type,--the fourth and last to the same abstractions, when seen in the unity of the idea, from which they derive a new meaning and power. EOS The true dialectical process begins with the contemplation of the real stars, and not mere reflections of them, and ends with the recognition of the sun, or idea of good, as the parent not only of light but of warmth and growth. EOS To the divisions of knowledge the stages of education partly answer:--first, there is the early education of childhood and youth in the fancies of the poets, and in the laws and customs of the State;--then there is the training of the body to be a warrior athlete, and a good servant of the mind;--and thirdly, after an interval follows the education of later life, which begins with mathematics and proceeds to philosophy in general. EOS According to him, the true education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to a comprehensive survey of all being. EOS He desires to develop in the human mind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last the particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. EOS He never understands that abstractions, as Hegel says, are 'mere abstractions'--of use when employed in the arrangement of facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart from them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of good. EOS All things in which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of reflection. EOS The mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind, but when sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished, then philosophy begins. EOS The follow in order the other sciences of plain and solid geometry, and of solids in motion, one branch of which is astronomy or the harmony of the spheres,--to this is appended the sister science of the harmony of sounds. EOS Plato seems also to hint at the possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical proportions, such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy, such as the Pythagoreans and even Aristotle make use of in Ethics and Politics, e.g. EOS The modern mathematician will readily sympathise with Plato's delight in the properties of pure mathematics. EOS He will not be disinclined to say with him:--Let alone the heavens, and study the beauties of number and figure in themselves. EOS He too will be apt to depreciate their application to the arts. EOS was not encouraged by the aid of the State in the age of Plato; and he will recognize the grasp of Plato's mind in his ability to conceive of one science of solids in motion including the earth as well as the heavens,--not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has been already made, that besides astronomy and harmonics the science of solids in motion may have other applications. EOS But he will also see (and perhaps without surprise) that in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge, Plato has fallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a priori by mathematical problems, and determine the principles of harmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear. EOS The simplicity and certainty of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the variation and complexity of the world of sense; hence the circumstance that there was some elementary basis of fact, some measurement of distance or time or vibrations on which they must ultimately rest, was overlooked by him. EOS The metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes mathematics as an instrument of education,--which strengthens the power of attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of construction, and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the quantitative differences of physical phenomena. EOS But while acknowledging their value in education, he sees also that they have no connexion with our higher moral and intellectual ideas. EOS In the attempt which Plato makes to connect them, we easily trace the influences of ancient Pythagorean notions. EOS There is no reason to suppose that he is speaking of the ideal numbers; but he is describing numbers which are pure abstractions, to which he assigns a real and separate existence, which, as 'the teachers of the art' (meaning probably the Pythagoreans) would have affirmed, repel all attempts at subdivision, and in which unity and every other number are conceived of as absolute. EOS Nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men, 'who,' in the words of the Timaeus, 'might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them.' EOS It is worthy of remark that the old Pythagorean ethical symbols still exist as figures of speech among ourselves. EOS Two passages seem to require more particular explanations. EOS The difficulty in this passage may be explained, like many others, from differences in the modes of conception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers. EOS The consciousness of form, colour, distance, is indistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of them. EOS Hence arises the question, 'What is great, what is small?' EOS and thus begins the distinction of the visible and the intelligible. EOS Three classes of harmonists are distinguished by him:--first, the Pythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion on music he was to consult Damon--they are acknowledged to be masters in the art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher import and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom Glaucon appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and Socrates ludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the intervals of sounds. EOS Both of these fall short in different degrees of the Platonic idea of harmony, which must be studied in a purely abstract way, first by the method of problems, and secondly as a part of universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good. EOS The allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning. EOS In other words, their principles are too wide for practical application; they are looking far away into the past and future, when their business is with the present. EOS The ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions of actual life, and may often be at variance with them. EOS And at first, those who return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den in the measurement of the shadows, and are derided and persecuted by them; but after a while they see the things below in far truer proportions than those who have never ascended into the upper world. EOS The difference between the politician turned into a philosopher and the philosopher turned into a politician, is symbolized by the two kinds of disordered eyesight, the one which is experienced by the captive who is transferred from darkness to day, the other, of the heavenly messenger who voluntarily for the good of his fellow-men descends into the den. EOS In what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the lower world, or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle of politics, is left unexplained by Plato. EOS Like the nature and divisions of dialectic, of which Glaucon impatiently demands to be informed, perhaps he would have said that the explanation could not be given except to a disciple of the previous sciences. EOS Many illustrations of this part of the Republic may be found in modern Politics and in daily life. EOS Mill or Burke himself, have been theorists or philosophers before they were politicians, or who, having been students of history, have allowed some great historical parallel, such as the English Revolution of 1688, or possibly Athenian democracy or Roman Imperialism, to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary events. EOS Or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing institution may have darkened their vision. EOS The Church of the future, the Commonwealth of the future, the Society of the future, have so absorbed their minds, that they are unable to see in their true proportions the Politics of to-day. EOS Almost every one has known some enthusiastic half-educated person, who sees everything at false distances, and in erroneous proportions. EOS With this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another--of those who see not far into the distance, but what is near only; who have been engaged all their lives in a trade or a profession; who are limited to a set or sect of their own. EOS Nor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young Athenian in the fifth century before Christ who became unsettled by new ideas, and the student of a modern University who has been the subject of a similar 'aufklarung.' EOS They are like trees which have been frequently transplanted. EOS The earth about them is loose, and they have no roots reaching far into the soil. EOS They catch opinions, as diseases are caught--when they are in the air. EOS Borne hither and thither, 'they speedily fall into beliefs' the opposite of those in which they were brought up. EOS They hardly retain the distinction of right and wrong; they seem to think one thing as good as another. EOS They suppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are playing the game of 'follow my leader.' EOS They fall in love 'at first sight' with paradoxes respecting morality, some fancy about art, some novelty or eccentricity in religion, and like lovers they are so absorbed for a time in their new notion that they can think of nothing else. EOS The resolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them more interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of literature or science or even than a good life. EOS Such is the picture which Plato draws and which we only reproduce, partly in his own words, of the dangers which beset youth in times of transition, when old opinions are fading away and the new are not yet firmly established. EOS Their condition is ingeniously compared by him to that of a supposititious son, who has made the discovery that his reputed parents are not his real ones, and, in consequence, they have lost their authority over him. EOS The contempt which he expresses for distinctions of words, the danger of involuntary falsehood, the apology which Socrates makes for his earnestness of speech, are highly characteristic of the Platonic style and mode of thought. EOS BOOK VIII. EOS And so we have arrived at the conclusion, that in the perfect State wives and children are to be in common; and the education and pursuits of men and women, both in war and peace, are to be common, and kings are to be philosophers and warriors, and the soldiers of the State are to live together, having all things in common; and they are to be warrior athletes, receiving no pay but only their food, from the other citizens. EOS Now let us return to the point at which we digressed. EOS Then Polemarchus and Adeimantus interrupted you, and this led to another argument,--and so here we are.' EOS Suppose that we put ourselves again in the same position, and do you repeat your question. EOS Besides the perfect State there are only four of any note in Hellas:--first, the famous Lacedaemonian or Cretan commonwealth; secondly, oligarchy, a State full of evils; thirdly, democracy, which follows next in order; fourthly, tyranny, which is the disease or death of all government. EOS Now, States are not made of 'oak and rock,' but of flesh and blood; and therefore as there are five States there must be five human natures in individuals, which correspond to them. EOS And first, there is the ambitious nature, which answers to the Lacedaemonian State; secondly, the oligarchical nature; thirdly, the democratical; and fourthly, the tyrannical. EOS But how did timocracy arise out of the perfect State? EOS Plainly, like all changes of government, from division in the rulers. EOS But whence came division? EOS 'Sing, heavenly Muses,' as Homer says;--let them condescend to answer us, as if we were children, to whom they put on a solemn face in jest. EOS They will say that human things are fated to decay, and even the perfect State will not escape from this law of destiny, when 'the wheel comes full circle' in a period short or long. EOS Plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility, which the intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable them to ascertain, and children will be born out of season. EOS The base of the number with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five and cubed, gives two harmonies:--the first a square number, which is a hundred times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong, being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which is five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. EOS This entire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of generation. EOS When this law is neglected marriages will be unpropitious; the inferior offspring who are then born will in time become the rulers; the State will decline, and education fall into decay; gymnastic will be preferred to music, and the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass--thus division will arise. EOS Such is the Muses' answer to our question. EOS 'And a true answer, of course:--but what more have they to say?' EOS They say that the two races, the iron and brass, and the silver and gold, will draw the State different ways;--the one will take to trade and moneymaking, and the others, having the true riches and not caring for money, will resist them: the contest will end in a compromise; they will agree to have private property, and will enslave their fellow-citizens who were once their friends and nurturers. EOS But they will retain their warlike character, and will be chiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule. EOS Thus arises timocracy, which is intermediate between aristocracy and oligarchy. EOS But corruption has crept into philosophy, and simplicity of character, which was once her note, is now looked for only in the military class. EOS Arts of war begin to prevail over arts of peace; the ruler is no longer a philosopher; as in oligarchies, there springs up among them an extravagant love of gain--get another man's and save your own, is their principle; and they have dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver, for the use of their women and others; they take their pleasures by stealth, like boys who are running away from their father--the law; and their education is not inspired by the Muse, but imposed by the strong arm of power. EOS And what manner of man answers to such a State? EOS 'In love of contention,' replied Adeimantus, 'he will be like our friend Glaucon.' EOS He is self-asserting and ill-educated, yet fond of literature, although not himself a speaker,--fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power and honour, which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms,--fond, too, of gymnastics and of hunting. EOS As he advances in years he grows avaricious, for he has lost philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of men. EOS His mother is angry at her loss of precedence among other women; she is disgusted at her husband's selfishness, and she expatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father. EOS The old family servant takes up the tale, and says to the youth:--'When you grow up you must be more of a man than your father.' EOS All the world are agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot, while a busybody is highly honoured and esteemed. EOS The young man compares this spirit with his father's words and ways, and as he is naturally well disposed, although he has suffered from evil influences, he rests at a middle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour. EOS And now let us set another city over against another man. EOS The decline begins with the possession of gold and silver; illegal modes of expenditure are invented; one draws another on, and the multitude are infected; riches outweigh virtue; lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour; misers of politicians; and, in time, political privileges are confined by law to the rich, who do not shrink from violence in order to effect their purposes. EOS Thus much of the origin,--let us next consider the evils of oligarchy. EOS Would a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because he was rich, or refuse a good one because he was poor? EOS And there are yet greater evils: two nations are struggling together in one--the rich and the poor; and the rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor, and are unwilling to pay for defenders out of their own money. EOS And have we not already condemned that State in which the same persons are warriors as well as shopkeepers? EOS But observe that these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature in them when they were rich than now that they are poor; they were miserable spendthrifts always. EOS They are the drones of the hive; only whereas the actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the two-legged things whom we call drones are some of them without stings and some of them have dreadful stings; in other words, there are paupers and there are rogues. EOS These are never far apart; and in oligarchical cities, where nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler, you will find abundance of both. EOS Avarice is enthroned as his bosom's lord, and assumes the style of the Great King; the rational and spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one immersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of wealth. EOS The love of honour turns to love of money; the conversion is instantaneous. EOS He has had no education, or he would never have allowed the blind god of riches to lead the dance within him. EOS And being uneducated he will have many slavish desires, some beggarly, some knavish, breeding in his soul. EOS The usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them; he passes by, and leaves his sting--that is, his money--in some other victim; and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum multiplied into a family of children, and is reduced into a state of dronage by him. EOS The only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit a man in his use of his property, or to insist that he shall lend at his own risk. EOS Now there are occasions on which the governors and the governed meet together,--at festivals, on a journey, voyaging or fighting. EOS The sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not despised; he sees the rich man puffing and panting, and draws the conclusion which he privately imparts to his companions,--'that our people are not good for much;' and as a sickly frame is made ill by a mere touch from without, or sometimes without external impulse is ready to fall to pieces of itself, so from the least cause, or with none at all, the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death. EOS And democracy comes into power when the poor are the victors, killing some and exiling some, and giving equal shares in the government to all the rest. EOS The manner of life in such a State is that of democrats; there is freedom and plainness of speech, and every man does what is right in his own eyes, and has his own way of life. EOS Hence arise the most various developments of character; the State is like a piece of embroidery of which the colours and figures are the manners of men, and there are many who, like women and children, prefer this variety to real beauty and excellence. EOS The great charm is, that you may do as you like; you may govern if you like, let it alone if you like; go to war and make peace if you feel disposed, and all quite irrespective of anybody else. EOS When you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same; a gentleman is desired to go into exile, and he stalks about the streets like a hero; and nobody sees him or cares for him. EOS The only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism. EOS Let us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case of the State, we will trace his antecedents. EOS He is the son of a miserly oligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary pleasures. EOS When in excess, they may be rightly called expensive pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones. EOS As in the State, so in the individual, there are allies on both sides, temptations from without and passions from within; there is reason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance with the oligarchical principle; and the two factions are in violent conflict with one another. EOS Sometimes the party of order prevails, but then again new desires and new disorders arise, and the whole mob of passions gets possession of the Acropolis, that is to say, the soul, which they find void and unguarded by true words and works. EOS And if any offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home, the false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to enter,--there is a battle, and they gain the victory; and straightway making alliance with the desires, they banish modesty, which they call folly, and send temperance over the border. EOS When the house has been swept and garnished, they dress up the exiled vices, and, crowning them with garlands, bring them back under new names. EOS Such is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to the unnecessary. EOS After a while he divides his time impartially between them; and perhaps, when he gets older and the violence of passion has abated, he restores some of the exiles and lives in a sort of equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure and then another; and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good and honourable, and others bad and vile, he shakes his head and says that he can make no distinction between them. EOS Thus he lives in the fancy of the hour; sometimes he takes to drink, and then he turns abstainer; he practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all; then again he would be a philosopher or a politician; or again, he would be a warrior or a man of business; he is     'Every thing by starts and nothing long.' EOS 'The great natural good of life,' says the democrat, 'is freedom.' EOS The State demands the strong wine of freedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes and insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved principle. EOS Anarchy is the law, not of the State only, but of private houses, and extends even to the animals. EOS Father and son, citizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a level; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom of the young man is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought morose. EOS The she-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses march along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes in their way. EOS 'That has often been my experience.' EOS At last the citizens become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written or unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master. EOS 'Glorious, indeed; but what is to follow?' EOS The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; for there is a law of contraries; the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom the greater the slavery. EOS You will remember that in the oligarchy were found two classes--rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with and without stings. EOS These two classes are to the State what phlegm and bile are to the human body; and the State-physician, or legislator, must get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of the hive. EOS Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more numerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there they are inert and unpractised, here they are full of life and animation; and the keener sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and prevent their opponents from being heard. EOS And there is another class in democratic States, of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is moreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and they make up the mass of the people. EOS When the people meet, they are omnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey, of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a taste only to the mob. EOS Their victims attempt to resist; they are driven mad by the stings of the drones, and so become downright oligarchs in self-defence. EOS The nature of the change is indicated in the old fable of the temple of Zeus Lycaeus, which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn into a wolf. EOS Now let the rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away again if he does not do so then. EOS Having got rid of foreign enemies, he makes himself necessary to the State by always going to war. EOS And the more hated he is, the more he will require trusty guards; but how will he obtain them? EOS 'They will come flocking like birds--for pay.' EOS Will he not rather obtain them on the spot? EOS He will take the slaves from their owners and make them his body-guard; these are his trusted friends, who admire and look up to him. EOS Are not the tragic poets wise who magnify and exalt the tyrant, and say that he is wise by association with the wise? EOS First, by robbing the temples of their treasures, which will enable him to lighten the taxes; then he will take all his father's property, and spend it on his companions, male or female. EOS Now his father is the demus, and if the demus gets angry, and says that a great hulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents, and bids him and his riotous crew begone, then will the parent know what a monster he has been nurturing, and that the son whom he would fain expel is too strong for him. EOS 'You do not mean to say that he will beat his father?' EOS Yes, he will, after having taken away his arms. EOS 'Then he is a parricide and a cruel, unnatural son.' EOS In the previous books Plato has described the ideal State; now he returns to the perverted or declining forms, on which he had lightly touched at the end of Book IV. EOS These he describes in a succession of parallels between the individuals and the States, tracing the origin of either in the State or individual which has preceded them. EOS Of the first decline he gives no intelligible account; he would not have liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal State, which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism or the natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes. EOS He throws a veil of mystery over the origin of the decline, which he attributes to ignorance of the law of population. EOS Like the ancients in general, he had no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of the education of the human race. EOS His ideal was not to be attained in the course of ages, but was to spring in full armour from the head of the legislator. EOS He appears not to have reflected upon the full meaning of his own words, 'In the brief space of human life, nothing great can be accomplished'; or again, as he afterwards says in the Laws, 'Infinite time is the maker of cities.' EOS The philosopher himself has lost the love of truth, and the soldier, who is of a simpler and honester nature, rules in his stead. EOS He is described as ill educated, but, like the Spartan, a lover of literature; and although he is a harsh master to his servants he has no natural superiority over them. EOS His character is based upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father, who in a troubled city has retired from politics; and his mother, who is dissatisfied at her own position, is always urging him towards the life of political ambition. EOS Such a character may have had this origin, and indeed Livy attributes the Licinian laws to a feminine jealousy of a similar kind. EOS For there is no trace in Greek history of a polity like the Spartan or Cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth, or of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy. EOS Sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a government based upon a qualification of property, which, according to Aristotle's mode of using words, would have been called a timocracy; and this in some cities, as at Athens, became the conducting medium to democracy. EOS But then we must remember that Plato is describing rather the contemporary governments of the Sicilian States, which alternated between democracy and tyranny, than the ancient history of Athens or Corinth. EOS There was no enormity which the Greek was not today to believe of them; the tyrant was the negation of government and law; his assassination was glorious; there was no crime, however unnatural, which might not with probability be attributed to him. EOS In this, Plato was only following the common thought of his countrymen, which he embellished and exaggerated with all the power of his genius. EOS The manner in which he speaks of them would rather tend to render doubtful his ever having 'consorted' with them, or entertained the schemes, which are attributed to him in the Epistles, of regenerating Sicily by their help. EOS Plato in a hyperbolical and serio-comic vein exaggerates the follies of democracy which he also sees reflected in social life. EOS To him democracy is a state of individualism or dissolution; in which every one is doing what is right in his own eyes. EOS But if he is not a believer in liberty, still less is he a lover of tyranny. EOS Each of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical gradation: the ideal State is under the rule of reason, not extinguishing but harmonizing the passions, and training them in virtue; in the timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution, whether of the State or of the individual, is based, first, upon courage, and secondly, upon the love of honour; this latter virtue, which is hardly to be esteemed a virtue, has superseded all the rest. EOS In the second stage of decline the virtues have altogether disappeared, and the love of gain has succeeded to them; in the third stage, or democracy, the various passions are allowed to have free play, and the virtues and vices are impartially cultivated. EOS But this freedom, which leads to many curious extravagances of character, is in reality only a state of weakness and dissipation. EOS The eighth book of the Republic abounds in pictures of life and fanciful allusions; the use of metaphorical language is carried to a greater extent than anywhere else in Plato. EOS We may remark,  (1), the description of the two nations in one, which become more and more divided in the Greek Republics, as in feudal times, and perhaps also in our own;  (2), the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of Pythagorean formula as equality among unequals;  (3), the free and easy ways of men and animals, which are characteristic of liberty, as foreign mercenaries and universal mistrust are of the tyrant;  (4), the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a speculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in modern times, and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern legislation. EOS Debt and land were the two great difficulties of the ancient lawgiver: in modern times we may be said to have almost, if not quite, solved the first of these difficulties, but hardly the second. EOS Still more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals: there is the family picture of the father and mother and the old servant of the timocratical man, and the outward respectability and inherent meanness of the oligarchical; the uncontrolled licence and freedom of the democrat, in which the young Alcibiades seems to be depicted, doing right or wrong as he pleases, and who at last, like the prodigal, goes into a far country (note here the play of language by which the democratic man is himself represented under the image of a State having a citadel and receiving embassies); and there is the wild-beast nature, which breaks loose in his successor. EOS There remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the Republic, the so-called number of the State. EOS ad Att.). EOS But such a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which Aristotle speaks of the number (Pol. EOS ), and would have been ridiculous to any reader of the Republic who was acquainted with Greek mathematics. EOS As little reason is there for supposing that Plato intentionally used obscure expressions; the obscurity arises from our want of familiarity with the subject. EOS On the other hand, Plato himself indicates that he is not altogether serious, and in describing his number as a solemn jest of the Muses, he appears to imply some degree of satire on the symbolical use of number. EOS Another help is the allusion in Aristotle, who makes the important remark that the latter part of the passage (Greek) describes a solid figure. EOS (Pol.--'He only says that nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain cycle; and that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are in the ratio of 4:3; and this when combined with a figure of five gives two harmonies; he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.') EOS Some further clue may be gathered from the appearance of the Pythagorean triangle, which is denoted by the numbers 3, 4, 5, and in which, as in every right-angled triangle, the squares of the two lesser sides equal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25). EOS ), i.e. EOS a number in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole; this is the divine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are complete. EOS He also speaks of a human or imperfect number, having four terms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another in certain proportions; these he converts into figures, and finds in them when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of number, which give two 'harmonies,' the one square, the other oblong; but he does not say that the square number answers to the divine, or the oblong number to the human cycle; nor is any intimation given that the first or divine number represents the period of the world, the second the period of the state, or of the human race as Zeller supposes; nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned (Arist.). EOS The second is the number of generations or births, and presides over them in the same mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them, or in which, according to the Pythagoreans, opportunity, justice, marriage, are represented by some number or figure. EOS This is probably the number 216. EOS This explanation derives a certain plausibility from the circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the Spartan citizens (Herod. EOS ), and would be what Plato might have called 'a number which nearly concerns the population of a city'; the mysterious disappearance of the Spartan population may possibly have suggested to him the first cause of his decline of States. EOS The lesser or square 'harmony,' of 400, might be a symbol of the guardians,--the larger or oblong 'harmony,' of the people, and the numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer respectively to the three orders in the State or parts of the soul, the four virtues, the five forms of government. EOS The harmony of the musical scale, which is elsewhere used as a symbol of the harmony of the state, is also indicated. EOS The terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as follows. EOS A perfect number (Greek), as already stated, is one which is equal to the sum of its divisors. EOS Thus 6, which is the first perfect or cyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. EOS (Greek) is the 'base' on which the whole calculation depends, or the 'lowest term' from which it can be worked out. EOS The words (Greek) have been variously translated--'squared and cubed' (Donaldson), 'equalling and equalled in power' (Weber), 'by involution and evolution,' i.e. EOS 'Waxing' (Greek) numbers, called also 'increasing' (Greek), are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors: e.g. EOS 12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21. EOS 'Waning' (Greek) numbers, called also 'decreasing' (Greek) are those which succeed the sum of their divisors: e.g. EOS 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13. EOS The words translated 'commensurable and agreeable to one another' (Greek) seem to be different ways of describing the same relation, with more or less precision. EOS The 'base,' or 'fundamental number, which has 1/3 added to it' (1 and 1/3) = 4/3 or a musical fourth. EOS (Greek) is a 'proportion' of numbers as of musical notes, applied either to the parts or factors of a single number or to the relation of one number to another. EOS The first harmony is a 'square' number (Greek); the second harmony is an 'oblong' number (Greek), i.e. EOS a number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are equal. EOS (Greek) = 'numbers squared from' or 'upon diameters'; (Greek) = 'rational,' i.e. EOS including fractions; e.g. EOS 49 is a square of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which = 5: 50, of an irrational diameter of the same. EOS For several of the explanations here given and for a good deal besides I am indebted to an excellent article on the Platonic Number by Dr. Donaldson (Proc. EOS of the Philol. EOS Society). EOS The conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as follows. EOS Having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle is the number of the world, and the number of the imperfect cycle the number of the state, he proceeds: 'The period of the world is defined by the perfect number 6, that of the state by the cube of that number or 216, which is the product of the last pair of terms in the Platonic Tetractys (a series of seven terms, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27); and if we take this as the basis of our computation, we shall have two cube numbers (Greek), viz. EOS 8 and 27; and the mean proportionals between these, viz. EOS 12 and 18, will furnish three intervals and four terms, and these terms and intervals stand related to one another in the sesqui-altera ratio, i.e. EOS each term is to the preceding as 3/2. EOS And if we combine the ratio 4/3 with the number 5, or multiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse, we shall by first squaring and then cubing obtain two expressions, which denote the ratio of the two last pairs of terms in the Platonic Tetractys, the former multiplied by the square, the latter by the cube of the number 10, the sum of the first four digits which constitute the Platonic Tetractys.' EOS The two (Greek) he elsewhere explains as follows: 'The first (Greek) is (Greek), in other words (4/3 x 5) all squared = 100 x 2 squared over 3 squared. EOS The second (Greek), a cube of the same root, is described as 100 multiplied (alpha) by the rational diameter of 5 diminished by unity, i.e., as shown above, 48: (beta) by two incommensurable diameters, i.e. EOS the two first irrationals, or 2 and 3: and (gamma) by the cube of 3, or 27. EOS This second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former harmony is the square, and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3. EOS In other words, the whole expression will be: (1), for the first harmony, 400/9: (2), for the second harmony, 8000/27.' EOS The reasons which have inclined me to agree with Dr. Donaldson and also with Schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the Platonic number of births are: (1) that it coincides with the description of the number given in the first part of the passage (Greek...): (2) that the number 216 with its permutations would have been familiar to a Greek mathematician, though unfamiliar to us: (3) that 216 is the cube of 6, and also the sum of 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, the numbers 3, 4, 5 representing the Pythagorean triangle, of which the sides when squared equal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25): (4) that it is also the period of the Pythagorean Metempsychosis: (5) the three ultimate terms or bases (3, 4, 5) of which 216 is composed answer to the third, fourth, fifth in the musical scale: (6) that the number 216 is the product of the cubes of 2 and 3, which are the two last terms in the Platonic Tetractys: (7) that the Pythagorean triangle is said by Plutarch (de Is. EOS et Osir. EOS ), and Quintilian (de Musica) to be contained in this passage, so that the tradition of the school seems to point in the same direction: (8) that the Pythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage (Greek). EOS two square numbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is 5 = 50 x 2. EOS The greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the words (Greek), 'a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied by 5.' EOS In this somewhat forced manner Plato introduces once more the numbers of the Pythagorean triangle. EOS But the coincidences in the numbers which follow are in favour of the explanation. EOS And here we take leave of the difficulty. EOS The discovery of the riddle would be useless, and would throw no light on ancient mathematics. EOS The point of interest is that Plato should have used such a symbol, and that so much of the Pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him. EOS His general meaning is that divine creation is perfect, and is represented or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number; human generation is imperfect, and represented or presided over by an imperfect number or series of numbers. EOS The number 5040, which is the number of the citizens in the Laws, is expressly based by him on utilitarian grounds, namely, the convenience of the number for division; it is also made up of the first seven digits multiplied by one another. EOS The contrast of the perfect and imperfect number may have been easily suggested by the corrections of the cycle, which were made first by Meton and secondly by Callippus; (the latter is said to have been a pupil of Plato). EOS Of the degree of importance or of exactness to be attributed to the problem, the number of the tyrant in Book IX (729 = 365 x 2), and the slight correction of the error in the number 5040/12 (Laws), may furnish a criterion. EOS There is nothing surprising in the circumstance that those who were seeking for order in nature and had found order in number, should have imagined one to give law to the other. EOS Plato believes in a power of number far beyond what he could see realized in the world around him, and he knows the great influence which 'the little matter of 1, 2, 3' exercises upon education. EOS He may even be thought to have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of Quetelet and others, that numbers depend upon numbers; e.g.--in population, the numbers of births and the respective numbers of children born of either sex, on the respective ages of parents, i.e. EOS on other numbers. EOS BOOK IX. EOS 'What appetites do you mean?' EOS I mean those which are awake when the reasoning powers are asleep, which get up and walk about naked without any self-respect or shame; and there is no conceivable folly or crime, however cruel or unnatural, of which, in imagination, they may not be guilty. EOS 'True,' he said; 'very true.' EOS To return:--You remember what was said of the democrat; that he was the son of a miserly father, who encouraged the saving desires and repressed the ornamental and expensive ones; presently the youth got into fine company, and began to entertain a dislike to his father's narrow ways; and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth, he came to a mean, and led a life, not of lawless or slavish passion, but of regular and successive indulgence. EOS Now imagine that the youth has become a father, and has a son who is exposed to the same temptations, and has companions who lead him into every sort of iniquity, and parents and friends who try to keep him right. EOS The counsellors of evil find that their only chance of retaining him is to implant in his soul a monster drone, or love; while other desires buzz around him and mystify him with sweet sounds and scents, this monster love takes possession of him, and puts an end to every true or modest thought or wish. EOS Love, like drunkenness and madness, is a tyranny; and the tyrannical man, whether made by nature or habit, is just a drinking, lusting, furious sort of animal. EOS And how does such an one live? EOS 'Nay, that you must tell me.' EOS Many desires require much money, and so he spends all that he has and borrows more; and when he has nothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were hatched, crying for food. EOS Love urges them on; and they must be gratified by force or fraud, or if not, they become painful and troublesome; and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones, so will the son take possession of the goods of his parents; if they show signs of refusing, he will defraud and deceive them; and if they openly resist, what then? EOS 'I can only say, that I should not much like to be in their place.' EOS But, O heavens, Adeimantus, to think that for some new-fangled and unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother, best and dearest of friends, or enslave them to the fancies of the hour! EOS He waxes strong in all violence and lawlessness; and is ready for any deed of daring that will supply the wants of his rabble-rout. EOS In a well-ordered State there are only a few such, and these in time of war go out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant. EOS 'No small catalogue of crimes truly, even if the perpetrators are few.' EOS Yes, I said; but small and great are relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them approach those of the tyrant, whom this class, growing strong and numerous, create out of themselves. EOS If the people yield, well and good, but, if they resist, then, as before he beat his father and mother, so now he beats his fatherland and motherland, and places his mercenaries over them. EOS Such men in their early days live with flatterers, and they themselves flatter others, in order to gain their ends; but they soon discard their followers when they have no longer any need of them; they are always either masters or servants,--the joys of friendship are unknown to them. EOS And they are utterly treacherous and unjust, if the nature of justice be at all understood by us. EOS Like man, like State,--the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny, which is the extreme opposite of the royal State; for one is the best and the other the worst. EOS But which is the happier? EOS Great and terrible as the tyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites, let us not be afraid to go in and ask; and the answer is, that the monarchical is the happiest, and the tyrannical the most miserable of States. EOS And may we not ask the same question about the men themselves, requesting some one to look into them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man, and will not be panic-struck by the vain pomp of tyranny? EOS I will suppose that he is one who has lived with him, and has seen him in family life, or perhaps in the hour of trouble and danger. EOS He cannot do what he would, and his mind is full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman. EOS No, not the most miserable, for there is yet a more miserable. EOS 'Who is that?' EOS He is like a wealthy owner of slaves, only he has more of them than any private individual. EOS You will say, 'The owners of slaves are not generally in any fear of them.' EOS Because the whole city is in a league which protects the individual. EOS 'Still worse and worse! EOS He will be in the midst of his enemies.' EOS And is not our tyrant such a captive soul, who is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge; living indoors always like a woman, and jealous of those who can go out and see the world? EOS Having so many evils, will not the most miserable of men be still more miserable in a public station? EOS His jealous, hateful, faithless temper grows worse with command; he is more and more faithless, envious, unrighteous,--the most wretched of men, a misery to himself and to others. EOS And so let us have a final trial and proclamation; need we hire a herald, or shall I proclaim the result? EOS The son of Ariston (the best) is of opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest, and that this is he who is the most royal master of himself; and that the unjust man is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his State. EOS And I add further--'seen or unseen by gods or men.' EOS Reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of truth, and careless of money and reputation. EOS In accordance with the difference of men's natures, one of these three principles is in the ascendant, and they have their several pleasures corresponding to them. EOS Now, how shall we decide between them? EOS Is there any better criterion than experience and knowledge? EOS The experience of youth makes the philosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire, but the avaricious and the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom. EOS Honour he has equally with them; they are 'judged of him,' but he is 'not judged of them,' for they never attain to the knowledge of true being. EOS And his instrument is reason, whereas their standard is only wealth and honour; and if by reason we are to judge, his good will be the truest. EOS He who has a right to judge judges thus. EOS Next comes the life of ambition, and, in the third place, that of money-making. EOS A wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the wise are true and pure; all others are a shadow only. EOS When a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him than health. EOS But this he never found out while he was well. EOS In pain he desires only to cease from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an ecstasy of pleasure, rest is painful to him. EOS Thus rest or cessation is both pleasure and pain. EOS But can that which is neither become both? EOS Again, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest; but if so, how can the absence of either of them be the other? EOS Thus we are led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only, and witchery of the senses. EOS Pure pleasure then is not the absence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most of the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of pain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their anticipations before they come. EOS They can be best described in a simile. EOS There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who passes from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would think, and truly think, that he was descending. EOS All this arises out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. EOS And a like confusion happens with pleasure and pain, and with many other things. EOS The man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure. EOS Again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and folly of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge of the other. EOS Now which is the purer satisfaction--that of eating and drinking, or that of knowledge? EOS Consider the matter thus: The satisfaction of that which has more existence is truer than of that which has less. EOS The soul, again, has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body, and is therefore more really satisfied and has a more natural pleasure. EOS Those who feast only on earthly food, are always going at random up to the middle and down again; but they never pass into the true upper world, or have a taste of true pleasure. EOS They are like fatted beasts, full of gluttony and sensuality, and ready to kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust; for they are not filled with true being, and their vessel is leaky (Gorgias). EOS The same may be said of the passionate element:--the desires of the ambitious soul, as well as of the covetous, have an inferior satisfaction. EOS Only when under the guidance of reason do either of the other principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is natural to them. EOS And the more distant they are from philosophy and reason, the more distant they will be from law and order, and the more illusive will be their pleasures. EOS The desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law, and those of the king are nearest to it. EOS There is one genuine pleasure, and two spurious ones: the tyrant goes beyond even the latter; he has run away altogether from law and reason. EOS Nor can the measure of his inferiority be told, except in a figure. EOS The oligarch, again, is thrice removed from the king, and thus we get the formula 3 x 3, which is the number of a surface, representing the shadow which is the tyrant's pleasure, and if you like to cube this 'number of the beast,' you will find that the measure of the difference amounts to 729; the king is 729 times more happy than the tyrant. EOS And this extraordinary number is NEARLY equal to the number of days and nights in a year (365 x 2 = 730); and is therefore concerned with human life. EOS This is the interval between a good and bad man in happiness only: what must be the difference between them in comeliness of life and virtue! EOS Perhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our discussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of justice. EOS First of all, fashion a multitudinous beast, having a ring of heads of all manner of animals, tame and wild, and able to produce and change them at pleasure. EOS Suppose now another form of a lion, and another of a man; the second smaller than the first, the third than the second; join them together and cover them with a human skin, in which they are completely concealed. EOS When this has been done, let us tell the supporter of injustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man. EOS The maintainer of justice, on the other hand, is trying to strengthen the man; he is nourishing the gentle principle within him, and making an alliance with the lion heart, in order that he may be able to keep down the many-headed hydra, and bring all into unity with each other and with themselves. EOS Thus in every point of view, whether in relation to pleasure, honour, or advantage, the just man is right, and the unjust wrong. EOS Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the God in man; the ignoble, that which subjects the man to the beast? EOS And if so, who would receive gold on condition that he was to degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst?--who would sell his son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men, for any amount of money? EOS Would he not be worse than Eriphyle, who sold her husband's life for a necklace? EOS Flattery and meanness again arise when the spirited element is subjected to avarice, and the lion is habituated to become a monkey. EOS 'What, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world' and become more and more wicked? EOS The man of understanding will honour knowledge above all; in the next place he will keep under his body, not only for the sake of health and strength, but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body and soul. EOS In the acquisition of riches, too, he will aim at order and harmony; he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure, but he will fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of his own soul. EOS Yes, but he will, in his own city; though probably not in his native country, unless by some divine accident. EOS 'You mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city, which has no place upon earth.' EOS But in heaven, I replied, there is a pattern of such a city, and he who wishes may order his life after that image. EOS Plato's account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation, and in this respect contrasts with the later Platonists and the views which are attributed to them by Aristotle. EOS He is not, like the Cynics, opposed to all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of the soul shall have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the Epicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of pain. EOS This is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which have no antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the Philebus), such as the pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and anticipation. EOS In the previous book he had made the distinction between necessary and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by Aristotle, and he now observes that there are a further class of 'wild beast' pleasures, corresponding to Aristotle's (Greek). EOS The pre-eminence of royal pleasure is shown by the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of the lower pleasures, while the two lower parts of the soul are incapable of judging the pleasures of reason. EOS Both in Plato and Aristotle we note the illusion under which the ancients fell of regarding the transience of pleasure as a proof of its unreality, and of confounding the permanence of the intellectual pleasures with the unchangeableness of the knowledge from which they are derived. EOS 2. EOS The number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant, and royal from tyrannical pleasures, is 729, the cube of 9. EOS Which Plato characteristically designates as a number concerned with human life, because NEARLY equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year. EOS He is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is immeasurable, and invents a formula to give expression to his idea. EOS Those who spoke of justice as a cube, of virtue as an art of measuring (Prot. EOS ), saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the figure of a line, or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the pleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729. EOS And in modern times we sometimes use metaphorically what Plato employed as a philosophical formula. EOS So we might say, that although the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad man, yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one minute of the one at an hour of the other ('One day in thy courts is better than a thousand'), or you might say that 'there is an infinite difference.' EOS And accordingly Plato finds the natural vehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers; this arithmetical formula he draws out with the utmost seriousness, and both here and in the number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth of his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure; just as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is verified when it has been only thrown into an abstract form. EOS In speaking of the number 729 as proper to human life, he probably intended to intimate that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the royal life. EOS The simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is effected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the mathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. EOS The square of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step towards the cube. EOS 3. EOS Towards the close of the Republic, Plato seems to be more and more convinced of the ideal character of his own speculations. EOS At the end of the 9th Book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city of philosophers on earth. EOS The vision which has received form and substance at his hands, is now discovered to be at a distance. EOS And yet this distant kingdom is also the rule of man's life. EOS ('Say not lo! EOS Thus a note is struck which prepares for the revelation of a future life in the following Book. EOS But the future life is present still; the ideal of politics is to be realized in the individual. EOS Many things pleased me in the order of our State, but there was nothing which I liked better than the regulation about poetry. EOS The division of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation. EOS I do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage on the understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge which heals error. EOS But much as I love the man, I love truth more, and therefore I must speak out: and first of all, will you explain what is imitation, for really I do not understand? EOS 'How likely then that I should understand!' EOS 'True, but in your presence I can hardly venture to say what I think.' EOS Let us assume the existence of beds and tables. EOS There is one idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker of each had in his mind when making them; he did not make the ideas of beds and tables, but he made beds and tables according to the ideas. EOS 'He must be a wizard indeed!' EOS You have only to take a mirror, and catch the reflection of the sun, and the earth, or anything else--there now you have made them. EOS 'Not if philosophers may be believed.' EOS Nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect relation to the truth. EOS God only made one, nor could he have made more than one; for if there had been two, there would always have been a third--more absolute and abstract than either, under which they would have been included. EOS We may therefore conceive God to be the natural maker of the bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker; but the painter is rather the imitator of what the other two make; he has to do with a creation which is thrice removed from reality. EOS And the tragic poet is an imitator, and, like every other imitator, is thrice removed from the king and from the truth. EOS And when we hear persons saying that Homer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the virtues, must we not infer that they are under a similar delusion? EOS they do not see that the poets are imitators, and that their creations are only imitations. EOS But if a person could create as well as imitate, he would rather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only; he would rather be the receiver than the giver of praise? EOS 'Yes, for then he would have more honour and advantage.' EOS Let us now interrogate Homer and the poets. EOS Friend Homer, say I to him, I am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your poems incidentally refer, but about their main subjects--war, military tactics, politics. EOS If you are only twice and not thrice removed from the truth--not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what good you have ever done to mankind? EOS Is there any city which professes to have received laws from you, as Sicily and Italy have from Charondas, Sparta from Lycurgus, Athens from Solon? EOS Or is there any Homeric way of life, such as the Pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is called after you? EOS 'No, indeed; and Creophylus (Flesh-child) was even more unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as tradition says, Homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve.' EOS Yes, but could this ever have happened if Homer had really been the educator of Hellas? EOS But they did not; and therefore we may infer that Homer and all the poets are only imitators, who do but imitate the appearances of things. EOS Imitation, then, is devoid of knowledge, being only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic and epic poets are imitators in the highest degree. EOS And now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to imitation. EOS Allow me to explain my meaning: Objects are differently seen when in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a distance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to impose upon us. EOS And the art of measuring and weighing and calculating comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for, as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the same and at the same time, cannot both of them be true. EOS But which of them is true is determined by the art of calculation; and this is allied to the better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are to the worse. EOS But is a man in harmony with himself when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? EOS Is there not rather a contradiction in him? EOS Let me further ask, whether he is more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in company. EOS Unfortunately, however, this latter furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts. EOS Whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed, especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of her. EOS Thus the poet is like the painter in two ways: first he paints an inferior degree of truth, and secondly, he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul. EOS He indulges the feelings, while he enfeebles the reason; and we refuse to allow him to have authority over the mind of man; for he has no measure of greater and less, and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth. EOS When we hear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious length, you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and yet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as effeminate and unmanly (Ion). EOS Now, ought a man to feel pleasure in seeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself? EOS Is he not giving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control?--he is off his guard because the sorrow is another's; and he thinks that he may indulge his feelings without disgrace, and will be the gainer by the pleasure. EOS But the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by weeping at the sorrows of others, will end by weeping at his own. EOS Poetry feeds and waters the passions and desires; she lets them rule instead of ruling them. EOS And therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of Homer affirming that he is the educator of Hellas, and that all life should be regulated by his precepts, we may allow the excellence of their intentions, and agree with them in thinking Homer a great poet and tragedian. EOS Not pleasure and pain, but law and reason shall rule in our State. EOS These are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge us with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. EOS Nevertheless we bear her no ill-will, and will gladly allow her to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in verse; and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose. EOS Having come to years of discretion, we know that poetry is not truth, and that a man should be careful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he himself is; for there is a mighty issue at stake--no less than the good or evil of a human soul. EOS 'I agree with you.' EOS 'And can we conceive things greater still?' EOS Not, perhaps, in this brief span of life: but should an immortal being care about anything short of eternity? EOS 'I do not understand what you mean?' EOS Do you not know that the soul is immortal? EOS 'Then let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.' EOS You would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. EOS The soul too has her own corrupting principles, which are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like. EOS But none of these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body. EOS The body, which is one thing, cannot be destroyed by food, which is another, unless the badness of the food is communicated to the body. EOS Neither can the soul, which is one thing, be corrupted by the body, which is another, unless she herself is infected. EOS And as no bodily evil can infect the soul, neither can any bodily evil, whether disease or violence, or any other destroy the soul, unless it can be shown to render her unholy and unjust. EOS But no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust when they die. EOS If a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer is--Then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and not die of themselves? EOS 'Truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.' EOS And if this be true, souls will always exist in the same number. EOS Thus far, as the argument required, we have said nothing of the rewards and honours which the poets attribute to justice; we have contented ourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in herself, even if a man should put on a Gyges' ring and have the helmet of Hades too. EOS In the first place, the just man is known to the Gods, and he is therefore the friend of the Gods, and he will receive at their hands every good, always excepting such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins. EOS All things end in good to him, either in life or after death, even what appears to be evil; for the Gods have a care of him who desires to be in their likeness. EOS And you must allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the fortunate unjust--they bear rule in the city, they marry and give in marriage to whom they will; and the evils which you attributed to the unfortunate just, do really fall in the end on the unjust, although, as you implied, their sufferings are better veiled in silence. EOS But all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared with those which await good men after death. EOS On the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre and there he came to life again, and told what he had seen in the world below. EOS He said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in which there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two corresponding chasms in the heaven above. EOS Him they told to look and listen, as he was to be their messenger to men from the world below. EOS They seemed glad to meet and rest awhile in the meadow; here they discoursed with one another of what they had seen in the other world. EOS He said that for every evil deed they were punished tenfold--now the journey was of a thousand years' duration, because the life of man was reckoned as a hundred years--and the rewards of virtue were in the same proportion. EOS Of parricides and other murderers he had tortures still more terrible to narrate. EOS He was present when one of the spirits asked--Where is Ardiaeus the Great? EOS Another spirit answered, 'He comes not hither, and will never come. EOS And I myself,' he added, 'actually saw this terrible sight. EOS At the entrance of the chasm, as we were about to reascend, Ardiaeus appeared, and some other sinners--most of whom had been tyrants, but not all--and just as they fancied that they were returning to life, the chasm gave a roar, and then wild, fiery-looking men who knew the meaning of the sound, seized him and several others, and bound them hand and foot and threw them down, and dragged them along at the side of the road, lacerating them and carding them like wool, and explaining to the passers-by, that they were going to be cast into hell.' EOS The greatest terror of the pilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice, and when there was silence one by one they passed up with joy. EOS To these sufferings there were corresponding delights. EOS On the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey, and in four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of light, in colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. EOS The whorl was in form like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges turned upwards, making together a single whorl which was pierced by the spindle. EOS The outermost had the rim broadest, and the inner whorls were smaller and smaller, and had their rims narrower. EOS The spindle turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren stood hymning upon each circle, while Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, the daughters of Necessity, sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing of past, present, and future, responsive to the music of the Sirens; Clotho from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her right hand; Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner circles; Lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to guide both of them. EOS A new period of mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you please; the responsibility of choosing is with you--God is blameless.' EOS After speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up the lot which fell near him. EOS He then placed on the ground before them the samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were all sorts of lives, of men and of animals. EOS Here, Glaucon, is the great risk of human life, and therefore the whole of education should be directed to the acquisition of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil and choose the good. EOS He should know all the combinations which occur in life--of beauty with poverty or with wealth,--of knowledge with external goods,--and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul, regarding that only as the better life which makes men better, and leaving the rest. EOS Like many another, he made a bad choice, because he had no experience of life; whereas those who came from earth and had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose. EOS But if a man had followed philosophy while upon earth, and had been moderately fortunate in his lot, he might not only be happy here, but his pilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly. EOS Nothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice, at once sad and laughable and wonderful; most of the souls only seeking to avoid their own condition in a previous life. EOS Men, too, were seen passing into animals, and wild and tame animals changing into one another. EOS When all the souls had chosen they went to Lachesis, who sent with each of them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot. EOS When they had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there were thunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly they were all driven divers ways, shooting like stars to their birth. EOS Concerning his return to the body, he only knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found himself lying on the pyre. EOS Thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved, and will be our salvation, if we believe that the soul is immortal, and hold fast to the heavenly way of Justice and Knowledge. EOS So shall we pass undefiled over the river of Forgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the Gods, and have a crown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the millennial pilgrimage of the other. EOS The argument, as in the Phaedo and Gorgias, is supplemented by the vision of a future life. EOS Why Plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and dramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and especially to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that truth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are some indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed in poetry--some elements of imagination which always entwine with reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably associated with the impurities of the old Hellenic mythology; why he should try Homer and Hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of utility,--are questions which have always been debated amongst students of Plato. EOS Though unable to give a complete answer to them, we may show--first, that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of his age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth as well as the error which is contained in them. EOS Euripides exhibited the last phase of the tragic drama, and in him Plato saw the friend and apologist of tyrants, and the Sophist of tragedy. EOS The old comedy was almost extinct; the new had not yet arisen. EOS Aristophanes, in one of his later comedies (Frogs), speaks of 'thousands of tragedy-making prattlers,' whose attempts at poetry he compares to the chirping of swallows; 'their garrulity went far beyond Euripides,'--'they appeared once upon the stage, and there was an end of them.' EOS To a man of genius who had a real appreciation of the godlike Aeschylus and the noble and gentle Sophocles, though disagreeing with some parts of their 'theology' (Rep.), these 'minor poets' must have been contemptible and intolerable. EOS There is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of Plato than a sense of the decline and decay both in literature and in politics which marked his own age. EOS There were other reasons for the antagonism of Plato to poetry. EOS The profession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human nature, for 'one man in his life' cannot 'play many parts;' the characters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character, and to leave nothing which can be truly called himself. EOS Neither can any man live his life and act it. EOS The actor is the slave of his art, not the master of it. EOS But great dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with firmness or strength of mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally associated with a weak or dissolute character. EOS First, he says that the poet or painter is an imitator, and in the third degree removed from the truth. EOS His creations are not tested by rule and measure; they are only appearances. EOS In modern times we should say that art is not merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in forms of sense. EOS Even adopting the humble image of Plato, from which his argument derives a colour, we should maintain that the artist may ennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery, or by the feeling of home which he introduces; and there have been modern painters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith's or a carpenter's shop. EOS Still more would this apply to the greatest works of art, which seem to be the visible embodiment of the divine. EOS Had Plato been asked whether the Zeus or Athene of Pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only, would he not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be found in them than in the form of any mortal; and that the rule of proportion to which they conformed was 'higher far than any geometry or arithmetic could express?' EOS (Statesman.) EOS Again, Plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the emotional rather than the rational part of human nature. EOS He does not admit Aristotle's theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are a purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only to afford the opportunity of indulging them. EOS It is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned. EOS Plato has himself admitted, in the earlier part of the Republic, that the arts might have the effect of harmonizing as well as of enervating the mind; but in the Tenth Book he regards them through a Stoic or Puritan medium. EOS He asks only 'What good have they done?' EOS and is not satisfied with the reply, that 'They have given innocent pleasure to mankind.' EOS He tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets, since he has found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the inferior faculties. EOS He means to say that the higher faculties have to do with universals, the lower with particulars of sense. EOS The poets, as he says in the Protagoras, were the Sophists of their day; and his dislike of the one class is reflected on the other. EOS He regards them both as the enemies of reasoning and abstraction, though in the case of Euripides more with reference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the like. EOS Whatever strangeness there may be in modern times in opposing philosophy to poetry, which to us seem to have so many elements in common, the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of poetry as allied to sense, and of philosophy as equivalent to thought and abstraction. EOS Unfortunately the very word 'idea,' which to Plato is expressive of the most real of all things, is associated in our minds with an element of subjectiveness and unreality. EOS We may note also how he differs from Aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history, for the opposite reason, because it is concerned with universals, not like history, with particulars (Poet). EOS The things which are seen are opposed in Scripture to the things which are unseen--they are equally opposed in Plato to universals and ideas. EOS To him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense; they have a taint of error or even of evil. EOS ; nor is the truth which is displayed in individual instances less certain than that which is conveyed through the medium of ideas. EOS But Plato, who is deeply impressed with the real importance of universals as instruments of thought, attributes to them an essential truth which is imaginary and unreal; for universals may be often false and particulars true. EOS But the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in all departments of life and knowledge, like the sophists and rhetoricians of the Gorgias and Phaedrus; they are the false priests, false prophets, lying spirits, enchanters of the world. EOS For no government of men depends solely upon force; without some corruption of literature and morals--some appeal to the imagination of the masses--some pretence to the favour of heaven--some element of good giving power to evil, tyranny, even for a short time, cannot be maintained. EOS A further objection which Plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts is that they excite the emotions. EOS Here the modern reader will be disposed to introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him. EOS True, the same power which in the purer age of art embodies gods and heroes only, may be made to express the voluptuous image of a Corinthian courtezan. EOS All imitative art is subject to certain limitations, and therefore necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise. EOS Something of ideal truth is sacrificed for the sake of the representation, and something in the exactness of the representation is sacrificed to the ideal. EOS Still, works of art have a permanent element; they idealize and detain the passing thought, and are the intermediates between sense and ideas. EOS But we can also imagine the existence of an age in which a severer conception of truth has either banished or transformed them. EOS At any rate we must admit that they hold a different place at different periods of the world's history. EOS In the infancy of mankind, poetry, with the exception of proverbs, is the whole of literature, and the only instrument of intellectual culture; in modern times she is the shadow or echo of her former self, and appears to have a precarious existence. EOS At the same time we must remember, that what Plato would have called the charms of poetry have been partly transferred to prose; he himself (Statesman) admits rhetoric to be the handmaiden of Politics, and proposes to find in the strain of law (Laws) a substitute for the old poets. EOS The modern English novel which is the most popular of all forms of reading is not more than a century or two old: will the tale of love a hundred years hence, after so many thousand variations of the same theme, be still received with unabated interest? EOS Art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion, and may often corrupt them. EOS The beginning of a great religion, whether Christian or Gentile, has not been 'wood or stone,' but a spirit moving in the hearts of men. EOS The disciples have met in a large upper room or in 'holes and caves of the earth'; in the second or third generation, they have had mosques, temples, churches, monasteries. EOS But poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and the purest sentiment. EOS Plato himself seems to waver between two opposite views--when, as in the third Book, he insists that youth should be brought up amid wholesome imagery; and again in Book X, when he banishes the poets from his Republic. EOS Admitting that the arts, which some of us almost deify, have fallen short of their higher aim, we must admit on the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be suicidal as well as impossible. EOS In the lower stages of civilization imagination more than reason distinguishes man from the animals; and to banish art would be to banish thought, to banish language, to banish the expression of all truth. EOS No religion is wholly devoid of external forms; even the Mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images has a temple in which he worships the Most High, as solemn and beautiful as any Greek or Christian building. EOS Feeling too and thought are not really opposed; for he who thinks must feel before he can execute. EOS And the highest thoughts, when they become familiarized to us, are always tending to pass into the form of feeling. EOS Plato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society. EOS But he feels strongly the unreality of their writings; he is protesting against the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest against the want of serious purpose in modern fiction, against the unseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists, against the time-serving of preachers or public writers, against the regardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to characterize the greater part of the world. EOS And we look in vain for that healthy atmosphere of which Plato speaks,--'the beauty which meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul, even in childhood, into harmony with the beauty of reason.' EOS For there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine perfection, the harmony of goodness and truth among men: a strain which should renew the youth of the world, and bring back the ages in which the poet was man's only teacher and best friend,--which would find materials in the living present as well as in the romance of the past, and might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the intractable materials of modern civilisation,--which might elicit the simple principles, or, as Plato would have called them, the essential forms, of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the complexity of modern society,--which would preserve all the good of each generation and leave the bad unsung,--which should be based not on vain longings or faint imaginings, but on a clear insight into the nature of man. EOS Then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose, two in one, united in the pursuit of knowledge, or the service of God and man; and feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts and heroic deeds as in the days of Dante or Petrarch; and many types of manly and womanly beauty might appear among us, rising above the ordinary level of humanity, and many lives which were like poems (Laws), be not only written, but lived by us. EOS A few such strains have been heard among men in the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, whom Plato quotes, not, as Homer is quoted by him, in irony, but with deep and serious approval,--in the poetry of Milton and Wordsworth, and in passages of other English poets,--first and above all in the Hebrew prophets and psalmists. EOS But the philosopher will still be justified in asking, 'How may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind?' EOS He is aware of the absurdity of mankind framing their whole lives according to Homer; just as in the Phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology upon rational principles; both these were the modern tendencies of his own age, which he deservedly ridicules. EOS It may be compared with those other paradoxes of the Gorgias, that 'No statesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was the head'; and that 'No Sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils' (Gorg.)... EOS Admitting the existence of the soul, we know of no force which is able to put an end to her. EOS Vice is her own proper evil; and if she cannot be destroyed by that, she cannot be destroyed by any other. EOS Yet Plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the incrustations of earth as to lose her original form; and in the Timaeus he recognizes more strongly than in the Republic the influence which the body has over the mind, denying even the voluntariness of human actions, on the ground that they proceed from physical states (Tim.). EOS In the Republic, as elsewhere, he wavers between the original soul which has to be restored, and the character which is developed by training and education... EOS The vision of another world is ascribed to Er, the son of Armenius, who is said by Clement of Alexandria to have been Zoroaster. EOS The philosophy of Heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from Zoroaster, and still less the myths of Plato. EOS The local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the Phaedrus and Phaedo. EOS Astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology; the great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a cylinder or box, containing the seven orbits of the planets and the fixed stars; this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on the knees of Necessity; the revolutions of the seven orbits contained in the cylinder are guided by the fates, and their harmonious motion produces the music of the spheres. EOS The column itself is clearly not of adamant. EOS The cylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a symbol as the figure of Necessity turning the spindle;--for the outermost rim is the sphere of the fixed stars, and nothing is said about the intervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens. EOS The description is both a picture and an orrery, and therefore is necessarily inconsistent with itself. EOS The column of light is not the Milky Way--which is neither straight, nor like a rainbow--but the imaginary axis of the earth. EOS This is compared to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour, and not to the undergirders of a trireme, but to the straight rope running from prow to stern in which the undergirders meet. EOS In both the fixed stars are distinguished from the planets, and they move in orbits without them, although in an opposite direction: in the Republic as in the Timaeus they are all moving round the axis of the world. EOS No distinct mention is made in the Republic of the circles of the same and other; although both in the Timaeus and in the Republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed to coincide with the motion of the whole. EOS The spectator may be supposed to look at the heavenly bodies, either from above or below. EOS There is no distinction between the equator and the ecliptic. EOS In the description of the meadow, and the retribution of the good and evil after death, there are traces of Homer. EOS The description of the axis as a spindle, and of the heavenly bodies as forming a whole, partly arises out of the attempt to connect the motions of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web, or weaving of the Fates. EOS The element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of the lots. EOS And as Plato does not like to make an assertion which is unproven, he more than confirms this statement a few sentences afterwards by the example of Odysseus, who chose last. EOS But the virtue which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man to choose; he must add to virtue knowledge, if he is to act rightly when placed in new circumstances. EOS The routine of good actions and good habits is an inferior sort of goodness; and, as Coleridge says, 'Common sense is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics,' so Plato would have said, 'Habit is worthless which is not based upon philosophy.' EOS The freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is distinctly asserted. EOS The life of man is 'rounded' by necessity; there are circumstances prior to birth which affect him (Pol.). EOS All men cannot have the first choice in everything. EOS But the lot of all men is good enough, if they choose wisely and will live diligently. EOS They are such touches of nature as the art of Defoe might have introduced when he wished to win credibility for marvels and apparitions. EOS Produced by Sue Asscher      SYMPOSIUM  By Plato   Translated by Benjamin Jowett     INTRODUCTION. EOS For in philosophy as in prophecy glimpses of the future may often be conveyed in words which could hardly have been understood or interpreted at the time when they were uttered (compare Symp.) EOS --which were wiser than the writer of them meant, and could not have been expressed by him if he had been interrogated about them. EOS Yet Plato was not a mystic, nor in any degree affected by the Eastern influences which afterwards overspread the Alexandrian world. EOS He was not an enthusiast or a sentimentalist, but one who aspired only to see reasoned truth, and whose thoughts are clearly explained in his language. EOS There is no foreign element either of Egypt or of Asia to be found in his writings. EOS And more than any other Platonic work the Symposium is Greek both in style and subject, having a beauty 'as of a statue,' while the companion Dialogue of the Phaedrus is marked by a sort of Gothic irregularity. EOS More too than in any other of his Dialogues, Plato is emancipated from former philosophies. EOS (Rep.)  An unknown person who had heard of the discourses in praise of love spoken by Socrates and others at the banquet of Agathon is desirous of having an authentic account of them, which he thinks that he can obtain from Apollodorus, the same excitable, or rather 'mad' friend of Socrates, who is afterwards introduced in the Phaedo. EOS Although he had not been present himself, he had heard them from the best authority. EOS Aristodemus, who is described as having been in past times a humble but inseparable attendant of Socrates, had reported them to him (compare Xen. EOS Mem.). EOS The narrative which he had heard was as follows:--  Aristodemus meeting Socrates in holiday attire, is invited by him to a banquet at the house of Agathon, who had been sacrificing in thanksgiving for his tragic victory on the day previous. EOS But no sooner has he entered the house than he finds that he is alone; Socrates has stayed behind in a fit of abstraction, and does not appear until the banquet is half over. EOS On his appearing he and the host jest a little; the question is then asked by Pausanias, one of the guests, 'What shall they do about drinking? EOS as they had been all well drunk on the day before, and drinking on two successive days is such a bad thing.' EOS The greatest of these is the sense of honour and dishonour. EOS The lover is ashamed to be seen by the beloved doing or suffering any cowardly or mean act. EOS And a state or army which was made up only of lovers and their loves would be invincible. EOS For love will convert the veriest coward into an inspired hero. EOS Such was the love of Alcestis, who dared to die for her husband, and in recompense of her virtue was allowed to come again from the dead. EOS For there are two loves, as there are two Aphrodites--one the daughter of Uranus, who has no mother and is the elder and wiser goddess, and the other, the daughter of Zeus and Dione, who is popular and common. EOS Now the actions of lovers vary, like every other sort of action, according to the manner of their performance. EOS And in different countries there is a difference of opinion about male loves. EOS At Athens and Sparta there is an apparent contradiction about them. EOS For at times they are encouraged, and then the lover is allowed to play all sorts of fantastic tricks; he may swear and forswear himself (and 'at lovers' perjuries they say Jove laughs'); he may be a servant, and lie on a mat at the door of his love, without any loss of character; but there are also times when elders look grave and guard their young relations, and personal remarks are made. EOS The truth is that some of these loves are disgraceful and others honourable. EOS The lover should be tested, and the beloved should not be too ready to yield. EOS The rule in our country is that the beloved may do the same service to the lover in the way of virtue which the lover may do to him. EOS A voluntary service to be rendered for the sake of virtue and wisdom is permitted among us; and when these two customs--one the love of youth, the other the practice of virtue and philosophy--meet in one, then the lovers may lawfully unite. EOS This is that love of the heavenly goddess which is of great price to individuals and cities, making them work together for their improvement. EOS The turn of Aristophanes comes next; but he has the hiccough, and therefore proposes that Eryximachus the physician shall cure him or speak in his turn. EOS In the human body also there are two loves; and the art of medicine shows which is the good and which is the bad love, and persuades the body to accept the good and reject the bad, and reconciles conflicting elements and makes them friends. EOS Every art, gymnastic and husbandry as well as medicine, is the reconciliation of opposites; and this is what Heracleitus meant, when he spoke of a harmony of opposites: but in strictness he should rather have spoken of a harmony which succeeds opposites, for an agreement of disagreements there cannot be. EOS Music too is concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and rhythm. EOS In the abstract, all is simple, and we are not troubled with the twofold love; but when they are applied in education with their accompaniments of song and metre, then the discord begins. EOS There is a similar harmony or disagreement in the course of the seasons and in the relations of moist and dry, hot and cold, hoar frost and blight; and diseases of all sorts spring from the excesses or disorders of the element of love. EOS For divination is the peacemaker of gods and men, and works by a knowledge of the tendencies of merely human loves to piety and impiety. EOS I dare say that I have omitted to mention many things which you, Aristophanes, may supply, as I perceive that you are cured of the hiccough. EOS Terrible was their strength and swiftness; and they were essaying to scale heaven and attack the gods. EOS Doubt reigned in the celestial councils; the gods were divided between the desire of quelling the pride of man and the fear of losing the sacrifices. EOS At last Zeus hit upon an expedient. EOS The two halves went about looking for one another, and were ready to die of hunger in one another's arms. EOS Then Zeus invented an adjustment of the sexes, which enabled them to marry and go their way to the business of life. EOS Now the characters of men differ accordingly as they are derived from the original man or the original woman, or the original man-woman. EOS Those who come from the man-woman are lascivious and adulterous; those who come from the woman form female attachments; those who are a section of the male follow the male and embrace him, and in him all their desires centre. EOS But if Hephaestus were to come to them with his instruments and propose that they should be melted into one and remain one here and hereafter, they would acknowledge that this was the very expression of their want. EOS There was a time when the two sexes were only one, but now God has halved them,--much as the Lacedaemonians have cut up the Arcadians,--and if they do not behave themselves he will divide them again, and they will hop about with half a nose and face in basso relievo. EOS Wherefore let us exhort all men to piety, that we may obtain the goods of which love is the author, and be reconciled to God, and find our own true loves, which rarely happens in this world. EOS And now I must beg you not to suppose that I am alluding to Pausanias and Agathon (compare Protag. EOS Some raillery ensues first between Aristophanes and Eryximachus, and then between Agathon, who fears a few select friends more than any number of spectators at the theatre, and Socrates, who is disposed to begin an argument. EOS This is speedily repressed by Phaedrus, who reminds the disputants of their tribute to the god. EOS For love is young and dwells in soft places,--not like Ate in Homer, walking on the skulls of men, but in their hearts and souls, which are soft enough. EOS He is all flexibility and grace, and his habitation is among the flowers, and he cannot do or suffer wrong; for all men serve and obey him of their own free will, and where there is love there is obedience, and where obedience, there is justice; for none can be wronged of his own free will. EOS And he is temperate as well as just, for he is the ruler of the desires, and if he rules them he must be temperate. EOS And he is wise too; for he is a poet, and the author of poesy in others. EOS He created the animals; he is the inventor of the arts; all the gods are his subjects; he is the fairest and best himself, and the cause of what is fairest and best in others; he makes men to be of one mind at a banquet, filling them with affection and emptying them of disaffection; the pilot, helper, defender, saviour of men, in whose footsteps let every man follow, chanting a strain of love. EOS Such is the discourse, half playful, half serious, which I dedicate to the god. EOS He begs to be absolved from speaking falsely, but he is willing to speak the truth, and proposes to begin by questioning Agathon. EOS The result of his questions may be summed up as follows:--  Love is of something, and that which love desires is not that which love is or has; for no man desires that which he is or has. EOS And love is of the beautiful, and therefore has not the beautiful. EOS And the beautiful is the good, and therefore, in wanting and desiring the beautiful, love also wants and desires the good. EOS Socrates professes to have asked the same questions and to have obtained the same answers from Diotima, a wise woman of Mantinea, who, like Agathon, had spoken first of love and then of his works. EOS Socrates, like Agathon, had told her that Love is a mighty god and also fair, and she had shown him in return that Love was neither, but in a mean between fair and foul, good and evil, and not a god at all, but only a great demon or intermediate power (compare the speech of Eryximachus) who conveys to the gods the prayers of men, and to men the commands of the gods. EOS Socrates asks: Who are his father and mother? EOS Like his mother he is poor and squalid, lying on mats at doors (compare the speech of Pausanias); like his father he is bold and strong, and full of arts and resources. EOS Such is the nature of Love, who is not to be confused with the beloved. EOS But Love desires the beautiful; and then arises the question, What does he desire of the beautiful? EOS He desires, of course, the possession of the beautiful;--but what is given by that? EOS And Love desires not only the good, but the everlasting possession of the good. EOS When beauty approaches, then the conceiving power is benign and diffuse; when foulness, she is averted and morose. EOS Because they too have an instinct of immortality. EOS There is no sameness of existence, but the new mortality is always taking the place of the old. EOS This is the reason why parents love their children--for the sake of immortality; and this is why men love the immortality of fame. EOS For the creative soul creates not children, but conceptions of wisdom and virtue, such as poets and other creators have invented. EOS And the noblest creations of all are those of legislators, in honour of whom temples have been raised. EOS Who would not sooner have these children of the mind than the ordinary human ones? EOS (Compare Bacon's Essays, 8:--'Certainly the best works and of greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men; which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public.') EOS I will now initiate you, she said, into the greater mysteries; for he who would proceed in due course should love first one fair form, and then many, and learn the connexion of them; and from beautiful bodies he should proceed to beautiful minds, and the beauty of laws and institutions, until he perceives that all beauty is of one kindred; and from institutions he should go on to the sciences, until at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science of universal beauty, and then he will behold the everlasting nature which is the cause of all, and will be near the end. EOS In the contemplation of that supreme being of love he will be purified of earthly leaven, and will behold beauty, not with the bodily eye, but with the eye of the mind, and will bring forth true creations of virtue and wisdom, and be the friend of God and heir of immortality. EOS Such, Phaedrus, is the tale which I heard from the stranger of Mantinea, and which you may call the encomium of love, or what you please. EOS He is led in drunk, and welcomed by Agathon, whom he has come to crown with a garland. EOS Alcibiades then insists that they shall drink, and has a large wine-cooler filled, which he first empties himself, and then fills again and passes on to Socrates. EOS He is informed of the nature of the entertainment; and is ready to join, if only in the character of a drunken and disappointed lover he may be allowed to sing the praises of Socrates:--  He begins by comparing Socrates first to the busts of Silenus, which have images of the gods inside them; and, secondly, to Marsyas the flute-player. EOS For Socrates produces the same effect with the voice which Marsyas did with the flute. EOS He is the great speaker and enchanter who ravishes the souls of men; the convincer of hearts too, as he has convinced Alcibiades, and made him ashamed of his mean and miserable life. EOS He then proceeds to mention some other particulars of the life of Socrates; how they were at Potidaea together, where Socrates showed his superior powers of enduring cold and fatigue; how on one occasion he had stood for an entire day and night absorbed in reflection amid the wonder of the spectators; how on another occasion he had saved Alcibiades' life; how at the battle of Delium, after the defeat, he might be seen stalking about like a pelican, rolling his eyes as Aristophanes had described him in the Clouds. EOS Like the satyr in his language too; for he uses the commonest words as the outward mask of the divinest truths. EOS Socrates piques Alcibiades by a pretended affection for Agathon. EOS Presently a band of revellers appears, who introduce disorder into the feast; the sober part of the company, Eryximachus, Phaedrus, and others, withdraw; and Aristodemus, the follower of Socrates, sleeps during the whole of a long winter's night. EOS And first Aristophanes drops, and then, as the day is dawning, Agathon. EOS Socrates, having laid them to rest, takes a bath and goes to his daily avocations until the evening. EOS Aristodemus follows. EOS ... EOS Some writings hardly admit of a more distinct interpretation than a musical composition; and every reader may form his own accompaniment of thought or feeling to the strain which he hears. EOS There are so many half-lights and cross-lights, so much of the colour of mythology, and of the manner of sophistry adhering--rhetoric and poetry, the playful and the serious, are so subtly intermingled in it, and vestiges of old philosophy so curiously blend with germs of future knowledge, that agreement among interpreters is not to be expected. EOS The power of love is represented in the Symposium as running through all nature and all being: at one end descending to animals and plants, and attaining to the highest vision of truth at the other. EOS Dan.) EOS Love became a mythic personage whom philosophy, borrowing from poetry, converted into an efficient cause of creation. EOS The traces of the existence of love, as of number and figure, were everywhere discerned; and in the Pythagorean list of opposites male and female were ranged side by side with odd and even, finite and infinite. EOS The same passion which may wallow in the mire is capable of rising to the loftiest heights--of penetrating the inmost secret of philosophy. EOS The highest love is the love not of a person, but of the highest and purest abstraction. EOS The unity of truth, the consistency of the warring elements of the world, the enthusiasm for knowledge when first beaming upon mankind, the relativity of ideas to the human mind, and of the human mind to ideas, the faith in the invisible, the adoration of the eternal nature, are all included, consciously or unconsciously, in Plato's doctrine of love. EOS The successive speeches in praise of love are characteristic of the speakers, and contribute in various degrees to the final result; they are all designed to prepare the way for Socrates, who gathers up the threads anew, and skims the highest points of each of them. EOS All of them are rhetorical and poetical rather than dialectical, but glimpses of truth appear in them. EOS When Eryximachus says that the principles of music are simple in themselves, but confused in their application, he touches lightly upon a difficulty which has troubled the moderns as well as the ancients in music, and may be extended to the other applied sciences. EOS When Pausanias remarks that personal attachments are inimical to despots. EOS The experience of Greek history confirms the truth of his remark. EOS When Aristophanes declares that love is the desire of the whole, he expresses a feeling not unlike that of the German philosopher, who says that 'philosophy is home sickness.' EOS When Agathon says that no man 'can be wronged of his own free will,' he is alluding playfully to a serious problem of Greek philosophy (compare Arist. EOS Ethics). EOS The characters--of Phaedrus, who has been the cause of more philosophical discussions than any other man, with the exception of Simmias the Theban (Phaedrus); of Aristophanes, who disguises under comic imagery a serious purpose; of Agathon, who in later life is satirized by Aristophanes in the Thesmophoriazusae, for his effeminate manners and the feeble rhythms of his verse; of Alcibiades, who is the same strange contrast of great powers and great vices, which meets us in history--are drawn to the life; and we may suppose the less-known characters of Pausanias and Eryximachus to be also true to the traditional recollection of them (compare Phaedr., Protag. EOS The speeches have been said to follow each other in pairs: Phaedrus and Pausanias being the ethical, Eryximachus and Aristophanes the physical speakers, while in Agathon and Socrates poetry and philosophy blend together. EOS ), that of Socrates as the philosophical. EOS When the turn of Socrates comes round he cannot be allowed to disturb the arrangement made at first. EOS With the leave of Phaedrus he asks a few questions, and then he throws his argument into the form of a speech (compare Gorg., Protag.). EOS But his speech is really the narrative of a dialogue between himself and Diotima. EOS And as at a banquet good manners would not allow him to win a victory either over his host or any of the guests, the superiority which he gains over Agathon is ingeniously represented as having been already gained over himself by her. EOS The artifice has the further advantage of maintaining his accustomed profession of ignorance (compare Menex.). EOS Even his knowledge of the mysteries of love, to which he lays claim here and elsewhere (Lys. EOS ), is given by Diotima. EOS The speeches are attested to us by the very best authority. EOS The madman Apollodorus, who for three years past has made a daily study of the actions of Socrates--to whom the world is summed up in the words 'Great is Socrates'--he has heard them from another 'madman,' Aristodemus, who was the 'shadow' of Socrates in days of old, like him going about barefooted, and who had been present at the time. EOS The extraordinary narrative of Alcibiades is ingeniously represented as admitted by Socrates, whose silence when he is invited to contradict gives consent to the narrator. EOS (5) We may notice the manner in which Socrates himself regards the first five speeches, not as true, but as fanciful and exaggerated encomiums of the god Love; (6) the satirical character of them, shown especially in the appeals to mythology, in the reasons which are given by Zeus for reconstructing the frame of man, or by the Boeotians and Eleans for encouraging male loves; (7) the ruling passion of Socrates for dialectics, who will argue with Agathon instead of making a speech, and will only speak at all upon the condition that he is allowed to speak the truth. EOS We may note also the touch of Socratic irony, (8) which admits of a wide application and reveals a deep insight into the world:--that in speaking of holy things and persons there is a general understanding that you should praise them, not that you should speak the truth about them--this is the sort of praise which Socrates is unable to give. EOS Lastly, (9) we may remark that the banquet is a real banquet after all, at which love is the theme of discourse, and huge quantities of wine are drunk. EOS The discourse of Phaedrus is half-mythical, half-ethical; and he himself, true to the character which is given him in the Dialogue bearing his name, is half-sophist, half-enthusiast. EOS He is the critic of poetry also, who compares Homer and Aeschylus in the insipid and irrational manner of the schools of the day, characteristically reasoning about the probability of matters which do not admit of reasoning. EOS He starts from a noble text: 'That without the sense of honour and dishonour neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work.' EOS The antiquity of love, the blessing of having a lover, the incentive which love offers to daring deeds, the examples of Alcestis and Achilles, are the chief themes of his discourse. EOS There is something of a sophistical ring in the speech of Phaedrus, which recalls the first speech in imitation of Lysias, occurring in the Dialogue called the Phaedrus. EOS Of course, he is 'playing both sides of the game,' as in the Gorgias and Phaedrus; but it is not necessary in order to understand him that we should discuss the fairness of his mode of proceeding. EOS The love of Pausanias for Agathon has already been touched upon in the Protagoras, and is alluded to by Aristophanes. EOS Hence he is naturally the upholder of male loves, which, like all the other affections or actions of men, he regards as varying according to the manner of their performance. EOS Like the sophists and like Plato himself, though in a different sense, he begins his discussion by an appeal to mythology, and distinguishes between the elder and younger love. EOS Pausanias is very earnest in the defence of such loves; and he speaks of them as generally approved among Hellenes and disapproved by barbarians. EOS As Eryximachus says, 'he makes a fair beginning, but a lame ending.' EOS Plato transposes the two next speeches, as in the Republic he would transpose the virtues and the mathematical sciences. EOS A suitable 'expectation' of Aristophanes is raised by the ludicrous circumstance of his having the hiccough, which is appropriately cured by his substitute, the physician Eryximachus. EOS There are loves and strifes of the body as well as of the mind. EOS Like Hippocrates the Asclepiad, he is a disciple of Heracleitus, whose conception of the harmony of opposites he explains in a new way as the harmony after discord; to his common sense, as to that of many moderns as well as ancients, the identity of contradictories is an absurdity. EOS His notion of love may be summed up as the harmony of man with himself in soul as well as body, and of all things in heaven and earth with one another. EOS Aristophanes is ready to laugh and make laugh before he opens his mouth, just as Socrates, true to his character, is ready to argue before he begins to speak. EOS He expresses the very genius of the old comedy, its coarse and forcible imagery, and the licence of its language in speaking about the gods. EOS He has no sophistical notions about love, which is brought back by him to its common-sense meaning of love between intelligent beings. EOS Nothing in Aristophanes is more truly Aristophanic than the description of the human monster whirling round on four arms and four legs, eight in all, with incredible rapidity. EOS Yet there is a mixture of earnestness in this jest; three serious principles seem to be insinuated:--first, that man cannot exist in isolation; he must be reunited if he is to be perfected: secondly, that love is the mediator and reconciler of poor, divided human nature: thirdly, that the loves of this world are an indistinct anticipation of an ideal union which is not yet realized. EOS The speech of Agathon is conceived in a higher strain, and receives the real, if half-ironical, approval of Socrates. EOS The speech may be compared with that speech of Socrates in the Phaedrus in which he describes himself as talking dithyrambs. EOS It is at once a preparation for Socrates and a foil to him. EOS While the consciousness of discord is stronger in the comic poet Aristophanes, Agathon, the tragic poet, has a deeper sense of harmony and reconciliation, and speaks of Love as the creator and artist. EOS All the earlier speeches embody common opinions coloured with a tinge of philosophy. EOS They furnish the material out of which Socrates proceeds to form his discourse, starting, as in other places, from mythology and the opinions of men. EOS That the distinction is a fallacy is obvious; it is almost acknowledged to be so by Socrates himself. EOS But Diotima, the prophetess of Mantineia, whose sacred and superhuman character raises her above the ordinary proprieties of women, has taught Socrates far more than this about the art and mystery of love. EOS The same want in the human soul which is satisfied in the vulgar by the procreation of children, may become the highest aspiration of intellectual desire. EOS 'This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church'); as the mediaeval saint might speak of the 'fruitio Dei;' as Dante saw all things contained in his love of Beatrice, so Plato would have us absorb all other loves and desires in the love of knowledge. EOS To most men reason and passion appear to be antagonistic both in idea and fact. EOS Yet this 'passion of the reason' is the theme of the Symposium of Plato. EOS And as there is no impossibility in supposing that 'one king, or son of a king, may be a philosopher,' so also there is a probability that there may be some few--perhaps one or two in a whole generation--in whom the light of truth may not lack the warmth of desire. EOS And if there be such natures, no one will be disposed to deny that 'from them flow most of the benefits of individuals and states;' and even from imperfect combinations of the two elements in teachers or statesmen great good may often arise. EOS Yet there is a higher region in which love is not only felt, but satisfied, in the perfect beauty of eternal knowledge, beginning with the beauty of earthly things, and at last reaching a beauty in which all existence is seen to be harmonious and one. EOS The limited affection is enlarged, and enabled to behold the ideal of all things. EOS And here the highest summit which is reached in the Symposium is seen also to be the highest summit which is attained in the Republic, but approached from another side; and there is 'a way upwards and downwards,' which is the same and not the same in both. EOS The ideal beauty of the one is the ideal good of the other; regarded not with the eye of knowledge, but of faith and desire; and they are respectively the source of beauty and the source of good in all other things. EOS And by the steps of a 'ladder reaching to heaven' we pass from images of visible beauty (Greek), and from the hypotheses of the Mathematical sciences, which are not yet based upon the idea of good, through the concrete to the abstract, and, by different paths arriving, behold the vision of the eternal (compare Symp. EOS (Greek) Republic (Greek) also Phaedrus). EOS Under one aspect 'the idea is love'; under another, 'truth.' EOS This is a 'mystery' in which Plato also obscurely intimates the union of the spiritual and fleshly, the interpenetration of the moral and intellectual faculties. EOS The divine image of beauty which resides within Socrates has been revealed; the Silenus, or outward man, has now to be exhibited. EOS At the height of divine inspiration, when the force of nature can no further go, by way of contrast to this extreme idealism, Alcibiades, accompanied by a troop of revellers and a flute-girl, staggers in, and being drunk is able to tell of things which he would have been ashamed to make known if he had been sober. EOS The singular part of this confession is the combination of the most degrading passion with the desire of virtue and improvement. EOS In imaginative persons, especially, the God and beast in man seem to part asunder more than is natural in a well-regulated mind. EOS The Platonic Socrates (for of the real Socrates this may be doubted: compare his public rebuke of Critias for his shameful love of Euthydemus in Xenophon, Memorabilia) does not regard the greatest evil of Greek life as a thing not to be spoken of; but it has a ridiculous element (Plato's Symp. EOS ), and is a subject for irony, no less than for moral reprobation (compare Plato's Symp.). EOS It is also used as a figure of speech which no one interpreted literally (compare Xen. EOS Symp.). EOS Nor does Plato feel any repugnance, such as would be felt in modern times, at bringing his great master and hero into connexion with nameless crimes. EOS by the beauty of young men and boys, which was alone capable of inspiring the modern feeling of romance in the Greek mind. EOS The 'army of lovers and their beloved who would be invincible if they could be united by such a tie' (Symp. EOS Vit. EOS ; Rep.; Laws; Symp. EOS ; and once more Xenophon, Mem. EOS To most of them we should hesitate to ascribe, any more than to the attachment of Achilles and Patroclus in Homer, an immoral or licentious character. EOS There were many, doubtless, to whom the love of the fair mind was the noblest form of friendship (Rep.), and who deemed the friendship of man with man to be higher than the love of woman, because altogether separated from the bodily appetites. EOS They were also an educational institution: a young person was specially entrusted by his parents to some elder friend who was expected by them to train their son in manly exercises and in virtue. EOS It is difficult to adduce the authority of Plato either for or against such practices or customs, because it is not always easy to determine whether he is speaking of 'the heavenly and philosophical love, or of the coarse Polyhymnia:' and he often refers to this (e.g. EOS We observe that they entered into one part of Greek literature, but not into another, and that the larger part is free from such associations. EOS But effeminate love was always condemned as well as ridiculed by the Comic poets; and in the New Comedy the allusions to such topics have disappeared. EOS Hellas was not necessarily more corrupted in the days of the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, or of Plato and the Orators, than England in the time of Fielding and Smollett, or France in the nineteenth century. EOS No one supposes certain French novels to be a representation of ordinary French life. EOS And the greater part of Greek literature, beginning with Homer and including the tragedians, philosophers, and, with the exception of the Comic poets (whose business was to raise a laugh by whatever means), all the greater writers of Hellas who have been preserved to us, are free from the taint of indecency. EOS (1) That good and evil are linked together in human nature, and have often existed side by side in the world and in man to an extent hardly credible. EOS We cannot distinguish them, and are therefore unable to part them; as in the parable 'they grow together unto the harvest:' it is only a rule of external decency by which society can divide them. EOS (2) It may be observed that evils which admit of degrees can seldom be rightly estimated, because under the same name actions of the most different degrees of culpability may be included. EOS And it is quite possible that the malignity of Greek scandal, aroused by some personal jealousy or party enmity, may have converted the innocent friendship of a great man for a noble youth into a connexion of another kind. EOS Such accusations were brought against several of the leading men of Hellas, e.g. EOS (3) While we know that in this matter there is a great gulf fixed between Greek and Christian Ethics, yet, if we would do justice to the Greeks, we must also acknowledge that there was a greater outspokenness among them than among ourselves about the things which nature hides, and that the more frequent mention of such topics is not to be taken as the measure of the prevalence of offences, or as a proof of the general corruption of society. EOS We cannot, though for different reasons, trust the representations either of Comedy or Satire; and still less of Christian Apologists. EOS Such we may believe to have been the tie which united Asophychus and Cephisodorus with the great Epaminondas in whose companionship they fell (Plutarch, Amat. EOS (5) A small matter: there appears to be a difference of custom among the Greeks and among ourselves, as between ourselves and continental nations at the present time, in modes of salutation. EOS But those who make these admissions, and who regard, not without pity, the victims of such illusions in our own day, whose life has been blasted by them, may be none the less resolved that the natural and healthy instincts of mankind shall alone be tolerated (Greek); and that the lesson of manliness which we have inherited from our fathers shall not degenerate into sentimentalism or effeminacy. EOS The possibility of an honourable connexion of this kind seems to have died out with Greek civilization. EOS The character of Alcibiades in the Symposium is hardly less remarkable than that of Socrates, and agrees with the picture given of him in the first of the two Dialogues which are called by his name, and also with the slight sketch of him in the Protagoras. EOS The dramatic interest of the character is heightened by the recollection of his after history. EOS There is no criterion of the date of the Symposium, except that which is furnished by the allusion to the division of Arcadia after the destruction of Mantinea. EOS This took place in the year B.C. EOS As Mantinea was restored in the year 369, the composition of the Dialogue will probably fall between 384 and 369. EOS Whether the recollection of the event is more likely to have been renewed at the destruction or restoration of the city, rather than at some intermediate period, is a consideration not worth raising. EOS The Symposium is connected with the Phaedrus both in style and subject; they are the only Dialogues of Plato in which the theme of love is discussed at length. EOS In both of them philosophy is regarded as a sort of enthusiasm or madness; Socrates is himself 'a prophet new inspired' with Bacchanalian revelry, which, like his philosophy, he characteristically pretends to have derived not from himself but from others. EOS The Phaedo also presents some points of comparison with the Symposium. EOS For there, too, philosophy might be described as 'dying for love;' and there are not wanting many touches of humour and fancy, which remind us of the Symposium. EOS But while the Phaedo and Phaedrus look backwards and forwards to past and future states of existence, in the Symposium there is no break between this world and another; and we rise from one to the other by a regular series of steps or stages, proceeding from the particulars of sense to the universal of reason, and from one universal to many, which are finally reunited in a single science (compare Rep.). EOS At first immortality means only the succession of existences; even knowledge comes and goes. EOS Enough for him to have attained the true beauty or good, without enquiring precisely into the relation in which human beings stood to it. EOS He is willing to rest in the contemplation of the idea, which to him is the cause of all things (Rep.), and has no strength to go further. EOS But the suspicion which hangs over other writings of Xenophon, and the numerous minute references to the Phaedrus and Symposium, as well as to some of the other writings of Plato, throw a doubt on the genuineness of the work. EOS Of this hostility there is no trace in the Memorabilia. EOS Such a rivalry is more characteristic of an imitator than of an original writer. EOS There are no means of determining the relative order in time of the Phaedrus, Symposium, Phaedo. EOS The order which has been adopted in this translation rests on no other principle than the desire to bring together in a series the memorials of the life of Socrates. EOS SYMPOSIUM   PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Apollodorus, who repeats to his companion the dialogue which he had heard from Aristodemus, and had already once narrated to Glaucon. EOS Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus, Aristophanes, Agathon, Socrates, Alcibiades, A Troop of Revellers. EOS SCENE: The House of Agathon. EOS So I did as I was bid; and then he said, I was looking for you, Apollodorus, only just now, that I might ask you about the speeches in praise of love, which were delivered by Socrates, Alcibiades, and others, at Agathon's supper. EOS Phoenix, the son of Philip, told another person who told me of them; his narrative was very indistinct, but he said that you knew, and I wish that you would give me an account of them. EOS Who, if not you, should be the reporter of the words of your friend? EOS And first tell me, he said, were you present at this meeting? EOS Why, yes, he replied, I thought so. EOS Impossible: I said. EOS Are you ignorant that for many years Agathon has not resided at Athens; and not three have elapsed since I became acquainted with Socrates, and have made it my daily business to know all that he says and does. EOS I thought that I ought to do anything rather than be a philosopher. EOS Well, he said, jesting apart, tell me when the meeting occurred. EOS In our boyhood, I replied, when Agathon won the prize with his first tragedy, on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered the sacrifice of victory. EOS No indeed, I replied, but the same person who told Phoenix;--he was a little fellow, who never wore any shoes, Aristodemus, of the deme of Cydathenaeum. EOS He had been at Agathon's feast; and I think that in those days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of Socrates. EOS Moreover, I have asked Socrates about the truth of some parts of his narrative, and he confirmed them. EOS And so we walked, and talked of the discourses on love; and therefore, as I said at first, I am not ill-prepared to comply with your request, and will have another rehearsal of them if you like. EOS And I dare say that you pity me in return, whom you regard as an unhappy creature, and very probably you are right. EOS But I certainly know of you what you only think of me--there is the difference. EOS APOLLODORUS: Yes, friend, and the reason why I am said to be mad, and out of my wits, is just because I have these notions of myself and you; no other evidence is required. EOS APOLLODORUS: Well, the tale of love was on this wise:--But perhaps I had better begin at the beginning, and endeavour to give you the exact words of Aristodemus:  He said that he met Socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled; and as the sight of the sandals was unusual, he asked him whither he was going that he had been converted into such a beau:--  To a banquet at Agathon's, he replied, whose invitation to his sacrifice of victory I refused yesterday, fearing a crowd, but promising that I would come to-day instead; and so I have put on my finery, because he is such a fine man. EOS Follow then, he said, and let us demolish the proverb:--  'To the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go;'  instead of which our proverb will run:--  'To the feasts of the good the good unbidden go;'  and this alteration may be supported by the authority of Homer himself, who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb. EOS I rather fear, Socrates, said Aristodemus, lest this may still be my case; and that, like Menelaus in Homer, I shall be the inferior person, who  'To the feasts of the wise unbidden goes.' EOS Welcome, Aristodemus, said Agathon, as soon as he appeared--you are just in time to sup with us; if you come on any other matter put it off, and make one of us, as I was looking for you yesterday and meant to have asked you, if I could have found you. EOS But what have you done with Socrates? EOS I turned round, but Socrates was nowhere to be seen; and I had to explain that he had been with me a moment before, and that I came by his invitation to the supper. EOS He was behind me just now, as I entered, he said, and I cannot think what has become of him. EOS Go and look for him, boy, said Agathon, and bring him in; and do you, Aristodemus, meanwhile take the place by Eryximachus. EOS The servant then assisted him to wash, and he lay down, and presently another servant came in and reported that our friend Socrates had retired into the portico of the neighbouring house. EOS 'There he is fixed,' said he, 'and when I call to him he will not stir.' EOS How strange, said Agathon; then you must call him again, and keep calling him. EOS Let him alone, said my informant; he has a way of stopping anywhere and losing himself without any reason. EOS I believe that he will soon appear; do not therefore disturb him. EOS Well, if you think so, I will leave him, said Agathon. EOS And then, turning to the servants, he added, 'Let us have supper without waiting for him. EOS After this, supper was served, but still no Socrates; and during the meal Agathon several times expressed a wish to send for him, but Aristodemus objected; and at last when the feast was about half over--for the fit, as usual, was not of long duration--Socrates entered. EOS How I wish, said Socrates, taking his place as he was desired, that wisdom could be infused by touch, out of the fuller into the emptier man, as water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier one; if that were so, how greatly should I value the privilege of reclining at your side! EOS For you would have filled me full with a stream of wisdom plenteous and fair; whereas my own is of a very mean and questionable sort, no better than a dream. EOS But yours is bright and full of promise, and was manifested forth in all the splendour of youth the day before yesterday, in the presence of more than thirty thousand Hellenes. EOS You are mocking, Socrates, said Agathon, and ere long you and I will have to determine who bears off the palm of wisdom--of this Dionysus shall be the judge; but at present you are better occupied with supper. EOS Socrates took his place on the couch, and supped with the rest; and then libations were offered, and after a hymn had been sung to the god, and there had been the usual ceremonies, they were about to commence drinking, when Pausanias said, And now, my friends, how can we drink with least injury to ourselves? EOS I entirely agree, said Aristophanes, that we should, by all means, avoid hard drinking, for I was myself one of those who were yesterday drowned in drink. EOS I am not equal to it, said Agathon. EOS Then, said Eryximachus, the weak heads like myself, Aristodemus, Phaedrus, and others who never can drink, are fortunate in finding that the stronger ones are not in a drinking mood. EOS (I do not include Socrates, who is able either to drink or to abstain, and will not mind, whichever we do.) EOS Well, as of none of the company seem disposed to drink much, I may be forgiven for saying, as a physician, that drinking deep is a bad practice, which I never follow, if I can help, and certainly do not recommend to another, least of all to any one who still feels the effects of yesterday's carouse. EOS I always do what you advise, and especially what you prescribe as a physician, rejoined Phaedrus the Myrrhinusian, and the rest of the company, if they are wise, will do the same. EOS It was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day, but that they were all to drink only so much as they pleased. EOS Then, said Eryximachus, as you are all agreed that drinking is to be voluntary, and that there is to be no compulsion, I move, in the next place, that the flute-girl, who has just made her appearance, be told to go away and play to herself, or, if she likes, to the women who are within (compare Prot.). EOS There are the worthy sophists too--the excellent Prodicus for example, who have descanted in prose on the virtues of Heracles and other heroes; and, what is still more extraordinary, I have met with a philosophical work in which the utility of salt has been made the theme of an eloquent discourse; and many other like things have had a like honour bestowed upon them. EOS And only to think that there should have been an eager interest created about them, and yet that to this day no one has ever dared worthily to hymn Love's praises! EOS Now in this Phaedrus seems to me to be quite right, and therefore I want to offer him a contribution; also I think that at the present moment we who are here assembled cannot do better than honour the god Love. EOS Let him give us the best which he can; and Phaedrus, because he is sitting first on the left hand, and because he is the father of the thought, shall begin. EOS How can I oppose your motion, who profess to understand nothing but matters of love; nor, I presume, will Agathon and Pausanias; and there can be no doubt of Aristophanes, whose whole concern is with Dionysus and Aphrodite; nor will any one disagree of those whom I see around me. EOS Let Phaedrus begin the praise of Love, and good luck to him. EOS All the company expressed their assent, and desired him to do as Socrates bade him. EOS Aristodemus did not recollect all that was said, nor do I recollect all that he related to me; but I will tell you what I thought most worthy of remembrance, and what the chief speakers said. EOS For he is the eldest of the gods, which is an honour to him; and a proof of his claim to this honour is, that of his parents there is no memorial; neither poet nor prose-writer has ever affirmed that he had any. EOS As Hesiod says:--  'First Chaos came, and then broad-bosomed Earth, The everlasting seat of all that is, And Love.' EOS And Acusilaus agrees with Hesiod. EOS For the principle which ought to be the guide of men who would nobly live--that principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honour, nor wealth, nor any other motive is able to implant so well as love. EOS Of what am I speaking? EOS Of the sense of honour and dishonour, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work. EOS And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves (compare Rep.), they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other's side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. EOS He would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. EOS Or who would desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? EOS That courage which, as Homer says, the god breathes into the souls of some heroes, Love of his own nature infuses into the lover. EOS Love will make men dare to die for their beloved--love alone; and women as well as men. EOS Of this, Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, is a monument to all Hellas; for she was willing to lay down her life on behalf of her husband, when no one else would, although he had a father and mother; but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded theirs, that she made them seem to be strangers in blood to their own son, and in name only related to him; and so noble did this action of hers appear to the gods, as well as to men, that among the many who have done virtuously she is one of the very few to whom, in admiration of her noble action, they have granted the privilege of returning alive to earth; such exceeding honour is paid by the gods to the devotion and virtue of love. EOS But Orpheus, the son of Oeagrus, the harper, they sent empty away, and presented to him an apparition only of her whom he sought, but herself they would not give up, because he showed no spirit; he was only a harp-player, and did not dare like Alcestis to die for love, but was contriving how he might enter Hades alive; moreover, they afterwards caused him to suffer death at the hands of women, as the punishment of his cowardliness. EOS Very different was the reward of the true love of Achilles towards his lover Patroclus--his lover and not his love (the notion that Patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into which Aeschylus has fallen, for Achilles was surely the fairer of the two, fairer also than all the other heroes; and, as Homer informs us, he was still beardless, and younger far). EOS Nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend, and dared to die, not only in his defence, but after he was dead. EOS Wherefore the gods honoured him even above Alcestis, and sent him to the Islands of the Blest. EOS These are my reasons for affirming that Love is the eldest and noblest and mightiest of the gods; and the chiefest author and giver of virtue in life, and of happiness after death. EOS This, or something like this, was the speech of Phaedrus; and some other speeches followed which Aristodemus did not remember; the next which he repeated was that of Pausanias. EOS Phaedrus, he said, the argument has not been set before us, I think, quite in the right form;--we should not be called upon to praise Love in such an indiscriminate manner. EOS If there were only one Love, then what you said would be well enough; but since there are more Loves than one,--should have begun by determining which of them was to be the theme of our praises. EOS I will amend this defect; and first of all I will tell you which Love is deserving of praise, and then try to hymn the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of him. EOS For we all know that Love is inseparable from Aphrodite, and if there were only one Aphrodite there would be only one Love; but as there are two goddesses there must be two Loves. EOS And am I not right in asserting that there are two goddesses? EOS The elder one, having no mother, who is called the heavenly Aphrodite--she is the daughter of Uranus; the younger, who is the daughter of Zeus and Dione--her we call common; and the Love who is her fellow-worker is rightly named common, as the other love is called heavenly. EOS All the gods ought to have praise given to them, but not without distinction of their natures; and therefore I must try to distinguish the characters of the two Loves. EOS Now actions vary according to the manner of their performance. EOS Take, for example, that which we are now doing, drinking, singing and talking--these actions are not in themselves either good or evil, but they turn out in this or that way according to the mode of performing them; and when well done they are good, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not every love, but only that which has a noble purpose, is noble and worthy of praise. EOS The Love who is the offspring of the common Aphrodite is essentially common, and has no discrimination, being such as the meaner sort of men feel, and is apt to be of women as well as of youths, and is of the body rather than of the soul--the most foolish beings are the objects of this love which desires only to gain an end, but never thinks of accomplishing the end nobly, and therefore does good and evil quite indiscriminately. EOS The goddess who is his mother is far younger than the other, and she was born of the union of the male and female, and partakes of both. EOS But the offspring of the heavenly Aphrodite is derived from a mother in whose birth the female has no part,--she is from the male only; this is that love which is of youths, and the goddess being older, there is nothing of wantonness in her. EOS And in choosing young men to be their companions, they mean to be faithful to them, and pass their whole life in company with them, not to take them in their inexperience, and deceive them, and play the fool with them, or run away from one to another of them. EOS But the love of young boys should be forbidden by law, because their future is uncertain; they may turn out good or bad, either in body or soul, and much noble enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them; in this matter the good are a law to themselves, and the coarser sort of lovers ought to be restrained by force; as we restrain or attempt to restrain them from fixing their affections on women of free birth. EOS Now here and in Lacedaemon the rules about love are perplexing, but in most cities they are simple and easily intelligible; in Elis and Boeotia, and in countries having no gifts of eloquence, they are very straightforward; the law is simply in favour of these connexions, and no one, whether young or old, has anything to say to their discredit; the reason being, as I suppose, that they are men of few words in those parts, and therefore the lovers do not like the trouble of pleading their suit. EOS In Ionia and other places, and generally in countries which are subject to the barbarians, the custom is held to be dishonourable; loves of youths share the evil repute in which philosophy and gymnastics are held, because they are inimical to tyranny; for the interests of rulers require that their subjects should be poor in spirit (compare Arist. EOS Politics), and that there should be no strong bond of friendship or society among them, which love, above all other motives, is likely to inspire, as our Athenian tyrants learned by experience; for the love of Aristogeiton and the constancy of Harmodius had a strength which undid their power. EOS In our own country a far better principle prevails, but, as I was saying, the explanation of it is rather perplexing. EOS For, observe that open loves are held to be more honourable than secret ones, and that the love of the noblest and highest, even if their persons are less beautiful than others, is especially honourable. EOS Consider, too, how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to the lover; neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable; but if he succeeds he is praised, and if he fail he is blamed. EOS And in the pursuit of his love the custom of mankind allows him to do many strange things, which philosophy would bitterly censure if they were done from any motive of interest, or wish for office or power. EOS Such is the entire liberty which gods and men have allowed the lover, according to the custom which prevails in our part of the world. EOS From this point of view a man fairly argues that in Athens to love and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing. EOS But when parents forbid their sons to talk with their lovers, and place them under a tutor's care, who is appointed to see to these things, and their companions and equals cast in their teeth anything of the sort which they may observe, and their elders refuse to silence the reprovers and do not rebuke them--any one who reflects on all this will, on the contrary, think that we hold these practices to be most disgraceful. EOS Evil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul, inasmuch as he is not even stable, because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable, and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over, he takes wing and flies away, in spite of all his words and promises; whereas the love of the noble disposition is life-long, for it becomes one with the everlasting. EOS For none of these things are of a permanent or lasting nature; not to mention that no generous friendship ever sprang from them. EOS There remains, then, only one way of honourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved, and this is the way of virtue; for as we admitted that any service which the lover does to him is not to be accounted flattery or a dishonour to himself, so the beloved has one way only of voluntary service which is not dishonourable, and this is virtuous service. EOS And these two customs, one the love of youth, and the other the practice of philosophy and virtue in general, ought to meet in one, and then the beloved may honourably indulge the lover. EOS For he who is gracious to his lover under the impression that he is rich, and is disappointed of his gains because he turns out to be poor, is disgraced all the same: for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any one's 'uses base' for the sake of money; but this is not honourable. EOS And on the same principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is a good man, and in the hope that he will be improved by his company, shows himself to be virtuous, even though the object of his affection turn out to be a villain, and to have no virtue; and if he is deceived he has committed a noble error. EOS Thus noble in every case is the acceptance of another for the sake of virtue. EOS But all other loves are the offspring of the other, who is the common goddess. EOS To you, Phaedrus, I offer this my contribution in praise of love, which is as good as I could make extempore. EOS Pausanias came to a pause--this is the balanced way in which I have been taught by the wise to speak; and Aristodemus said that the turn of Aristophanes was next, but either he had eaten too much, or from some other cause he had the hiccough, and was obliged to change turns with Eryximachus the physician, who was reclining on the couch below him. EOS I will do as you prescribe, said Aristophanes, and now get on. EOS Eryximachus spoke as follows: Seeing that Pausanias made a fair beginning, and but a lame ending, I must endeavour to supply his deficiency. EOS I think that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of love. EOS And this is what the physician has to do, and in this the art of medicine consists: for medicine may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves and desires of the body, and how to satisfy them or not; and the best physician is he who is able to separate fair love from foul, or to convert one into the other; and he who knows how to eradicate and how to implant love, whichever is required, and can reconcile the most hostile elements in the constitution and make them loving friends, is a skilful practitioner. EOS Now the most hostile are the most opposite, such as hot and cold, bitter and sweet, moist and dry, and the like. EOS And my ancestor, Asclepius, knowing how to implant friendship and accord in these elements, was the creator of our art, as our friends the poets here tell us, and I believe them; and not only medicine in every branch but the arts of gymnastic and husbandry are under his dominion. EOS Now there is an absurdity saying that harmony is discord or is composed of elements which are still in a state of discord. EOS But what he probably meant was, that harmony is composed of differing notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once, but are now reconciled by the art of music; for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed, there could be no harmony,--clearly not. EOS For harmony is a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonize that which disagrees. EOS In like manner rhythm is compounded of elements short and long, once differing and now in accord; which accordance, as in the former instance, medicine, so in all these other cases, music implants, making love and unison to grow up among them; and thus music, too, is concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and rhythm. EOS Again, in the essential nature of harmony and rhythm there is no difficulty in discerning love which has not yet become double. EOS But when you want to use them in actual life, either in the composition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metres composed already, which latter is called education, then the difficulty begins, and the good artist is needed. EOS Whence I infer that in music, in medicine, in all other things human as well as divine, both loves ought to be noted as far as may be, for they are both present. EOS The course of the seasons is also full of both these principles; and when, as I was saying, the elements of hot and cold, moist and dry, attain the harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance and harmony, they bring to men, animals, and plants health and plenty, and do them no harm; whereas the wanton love, getting the upper hand and affecting the seasons of the year, is very destructive and injurious, being the source of pestilence, and bringing many other kinds of diseases on animals and plants; for hoar-frost and hail and blight spring from the excesses and disorders of these elements of love, which to know in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies and the seasons of the year is termed astronomy. EOS Furthermore all sacrifices and the whole province of divination, which is the art of communion between gods and men--these, I say, are concerned only with the preservation of the good and the cure of the evil love. EOS Wherefore the business of divination is to see to these loves and to heal them, and divination is the peacemaker of gods and men, working by a knowledge of the religious or irreligious tendencies which exist in human loves. EOS Such is the great and mighty, or rather omnipotent force of love in general. EOS And the love, more especially, which is concerned with the good, and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatest power, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes us friends with the gods who are above us, and with one another. EOS I dare say that I too have omitted several things which might be said in praise of Love, but this was not intentional, and you, Aristophanes, may now supply the omission or take some other line of commendation; for I perceive that you are rid of the hiccough. EOS Yes, said Aristophanes, who followed, the hiccough is gone; not, however, until I applied the sneezing; and I wonder whether the harmony of the body has a love of such noises and ticklings, for I no sooner applied the sneezing than I was cured. EOS Do you expect to shoot your bolt and escape, Aristophanes? EOS Aristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse; he had a mind to praise Love in another way, unlike that either of Pausanias or Eryximachus. EOS For if they had understood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars, and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour; but this is not done, and most certainly ought to be done: since of all the gods he is the best friend of men, the helper and the healer of the ills which are the great impediment to the happiness of the race. EOS In the first place, let me treat of the nature of man and what has happened to it; for the original human nature was not like the present, but different. EOS He could walk upright as men now do, backwards or forwards as he pleased, and he could also roll over and over at a great pace, turning on his four hands and four feet, eight in all, like tumblers going over and over with their legs in the air; this was when he wanted to run fast. EOS Doubt reigned in the celestial councils. EOS At last, after a good deal of reflection, Zeus discovered a way. EOS He said: 'Methinks I have a plan which will humble their pride and improve their manners; men shall continue to exist, but I will cut them in two and then they will be diminished in strength and increased in numbers; this will have the advantage of making them more profitable to us. EOS He spoke and cut men in two, like a sorb-apple which is halved for pickling, or as you might divide an egg with a hair; and as he cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn in order that the man might contemplate the section of himself: he would thus learn a lesson of humility. EOS Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. EOS So he gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre, which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state. EOS After the division the two parts of man, each desiring his other half, came together, and throwing their arms about one another, entwined in mutual embraces, longing to grow into one, they were on the point of dying from hunger and self-neglect, because they did not like to do anything apart; and when one of the halves died and the other survived, the survivor sought another mate, man or woman as we call them,--being the sections of entire men or women,--and clung to that. EOS But they who are a section of the male follow the male, and while they are young, being slices of the original man, they hang about men and embrace them, and they are themselves the best of boys and youths, because they have the most manly nature. EOS Some indeed assert that they are shameless, but this is not true; for they do not act thus from any want of shame, but because they are valiant and manly, and have a manly countenance, and they embrace that which is like them. EOS And these when they grow up become our statesmen, and these only, which is a great proof of the truth of what I am saving. EOS And when one of them meets with his other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and one will not be out of the other's sight, as I may say, even for a moment: these are the people who pass their whole lives together; yet they could not explain what they desire of one another. EOS for if this is what you desire, I am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live live a common life as if you were a single man, and after your death in the world below still be one departed soul instead of two--I ask whether this is what you lovingly desire, and whether you are satisfied to attain this?' EOS --there is not a man of them who when he heard the proposal would deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need (compare Arist. EOS And the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love. EOS There was a time, I say, when we were one, but now because of the wickedness of mankind God has dispersed us, as the Arcadians were dispersed into villages by the Lacedaemonians (compare Arist. EOS And if we are not obedient to the gods, there is a danger that we shall be split up again and go about in basso-relievo, like the profile figures having only half a nose which are sculptured on monuments, and that we shall be like tallies. EOS Wherefore let us exhort all men to piety, that we may avoid evil, and obtain the good, of which Love is to us the lord and minister; and let no one oppose him--he is the enemy of the gods who opposes him. EOS For if we are friends of the God and at peace with him we shall find our own true loves, which rarely happens in this world at present. EOS I am serious, and therefore I must beg Eryximachus not to make fun or to find any allusion in what I am saying to Pausanias and Agathon, who, as I suspect, are both of the manly nature, and belong to the class which I have been describing. EOS But my words have a wider application--they include men and women everywhere; and I believe that if our loves were perfectly accomplished, and each one returning to his primeval nature had his original true love, then our race would be happy. EOS Wherefore, if we would praise him who has given to us the benefit, we must praise the god Love, who is our greatest benefactor, both leading us in this life back to our own nature, and giving us high hopes for the future, for he promises that if we are pious, he will restore us to our original state, and heal us and make us happy and blessed. EOS This, Eryximachus, is my discourse of love, which, although different to yours, I must beg you to leave unassailed by the shafts of your ridicule, in order that each may have his turn; each, or rather either, for Agathon and Socrates are the only ones left. EOS Indeed, I am not going to attack you, said Eryximachus, for I thought your speech charming, and did I not know that Agathon and Socrates are masters in the art of love, I should be really afraid that they would have nothing to say, after the world of things which have been said already. EOS Socrates said: You played your part well, Eryximachus; but if you were as I am now, or rather as I shall be when Agathon has spoken, you would, indeed, be in a great strait. EOS I should be strangely forgetful, Agathon replied Socrates, of the courage and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions were about to be exhibited, and you came upon the stage with the actors and faced the vast theatre altogether undismayed, if I thought that your nerves could be fluttered at a small party of friends. EOS Do you think, Socrates, said Agathon, that my head is so full of the theatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a few good judges are than many fools? EOS Nay, replied Socrates, I should be very wrong in attributing to you, Agathon, that or any other want of refinement. EOS But then we, having been a part of the foolish many in the theatre, cannot be regarded as the select wise; though I know that if you chanced to be in the presence, not of one of ourselves, but of some really wise man, you would be ashamed of disgracing yourself before him--would you not? EOS Yes, said Agathon. EOS But before the many you would not be ashamed, if you thought that you were doing something disgraceful in their presence? EOS Very good, Phaedrus, said Agathon; I see no reason why I should not proceed with my speech, as I shall have many other opportunities of conversing with Socrates. EOS But I would rather praise the god first, and then speak of his gifts; this is always the right way of praising everything. EOS Many things were said by Phaedrus about Love in which I agree with him; but I cannot agree that he is older than Iapetus and Kronos:--not so; I maintain him to be the youngest of the gods, and youthful ever. EOS Let us adduce a similar proof of the tenderness of Love; for he walks not upon the earth, nor yet upon the skulls of men, which are not so very soft, but in the hearts and souls of both gods and men, which are of all things the softest: in them he walks and dwells and makes his home. EOS Not in every soul without exception, for where there is hardness he departs, where there is softness there he dwells; and nestling always with his feet and in all manner of ways in the softest of soft places, how can he be other than the softest of all things? EOS And a proof of his flexibility and symmetry of form is his grace, which is universally admitted to be in an especial manner the attribute of Love; ungrace and love are always at war with one another. EOS The fairness of his complexion is revealed by his habitation among the flowers; for he dwells not amid bloomless or fading beauties, whether of body or soul or aught else, but in the place of flowers and scents, there he sits and abides. EOS Concerning the beauty of the god I have said enough; and yet there remains much more which I might say. EOS Of his courage and justice and temperance I have spoken, but I have yet to speak of his wisdom; and according to the measure of my ability I must try to do my best. EOS In the first place he is a poet (and here, like Eryximachus, I magnify my art), and he is also the source of poesy in others, which he could not be if he were not himself a poet. EOS ); this also is a proof that Love is a good poet and accomplished in all the fine arts; for no one can give to another that which he has not himself, or teach that of which he has no knowledge. EOS And as to the artists, do we not know that he only of them whom love inspires has the light of fame?--he whom Love touches not walks in darkness. EOS Also the melody of the Muses, the metallurgy of Hephaestus, the weaving of Athene, the empire of Zeus over gods and men, are all due to Love, who was the inventor of them. EOS And there comes into my mind a line of poetry in which he is said to be the god who  'Gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep, Who stills the winds and bids the sufferer sleep.' EOS This is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them with affection, who makes them to meet together at banquets such as these: in sacrifices, feasts, dances, he is our lord--who sends courtesy and sends away discourtesy, who gives kindness ever and never gives unkindness; the friend of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the gods; desired by those who have no part in him, and precious to those who have the better part in him; parent of delicacy, luxury, desire, fondness, softness, grace; regardful of the good, regardless of the evil: in every word, work, wish, fear--saviour, pilot, comrade, helper; glory of gods and men, leader best and brightest: in whose footsteps let every man follow, sweetly singing in his honour and joining in that sweet strain with which love charms the souls of gods and men. EOS When Agathon had done speaking, Aristodemus said that there was a general cheer; the young man was thought to have spoken in a manner worthy of himself, and of the god. EOS And Socrates, looking at Eryximachus, said: Tell me, son of Acumenus, was there not reason in my fears? EOS and was I not a true prophet when I said that Agathon would make a wonderful oration, and that I should be in a strait? EOS The part of the prophecy which concerns Agathon, replied Eryximachus, appears to me to be true; but not the other part--that you will be in a strait. EOS Why, my dear friend, said Socrates, must not I or any one be in a strait who has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied discourse? EOS When I reflected on the immeasurable inferiority of my own powers, I was ready to run away for shame, if there had been a possibility of escape. EOS And I felt quite proud, thinking that I knew the nature of true praise, and should speak well. EOS Whereas I now see that the intention was to attribute to Love every species of greatness and glory, whether really belonging to him or not, without regard to truth or falsehood--that was no matter; for the original proposal seems to have been not that each of you should really praise Love, but only that you should appear to praise him. EOS And so you attribute to Love every imaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere; and you say that 'he is all this,' and 'the cause of all that,' making him appear the fairest and best of all to those who know him not, for you cannot impose upon those who know him. EOS And a noble and solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed. EOS But as I misunderstood the nature of the praise when I said that I would take my turn, I must beg to be absolved from the promise which I made in ignorance, and which (as Euripides would say (Eurip. EOS Hyppolytus)) was a promise of the lips and not of the mind. EOS Farewell then to such a strain: for I do not praise in that way; no, indeed, I cannot. EOS But if you like to hear the truth about love, I am ready to speak in my own manner, though I will not make myself ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you. EOS Say then, Phaedrus, whether you would like to have the truth about love, spoken in any words and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time. EOS Will that be agreeable to you? EOS I grant the permission, said Phaedrus: put your questions. EOS And as you have spoken so eloquently of his nature, may I ask you further, Whether love is the love of something or of nothing? EOS And here I must explain myself: I do not want you to say that love is the love of a father or the love of a mother--that would be ridiculous; but to answer as you would, if I asked is a father a father of something? EOS Very true, said Agathon. EOS He assented. EOS Certainly, he replied. EOS Yes, he said. EOS And now, said Socrates, I will ask about Love:--Is Love of something or of nothing? EOS Of something, surely, he replied. EOS And does he possess, or does he not possess, that which he loves and desires? EOS Probably not, I should say. EOS Nay, replied Socrates, I would have you consider whether 'necessarily' is not rather the word. EOS The inference that he who desires something is in want of something, and that he who desires nothing is in want of nothing, is in my judgment, Agathon, absolutely and necessarily true. EOS What do you think? EOS Very good. EOS That would be inconsistent with our previous admissions. EOS True. EOS Very true. EOS And yet, added Socrates, if a man being strong desired to be strong, or being swift desired to be swift, or being healthy desired to be healthy, in that case he might be thought to desire something which he already has or is. EOS I give the example in order that we may avoid misconception. EOS For the possessors of these qualities, Agathon, must be supposed to have their respective advantages at the time, whether they choose or not; and who can desire that which he has? EOS Therefore, when a person says, I am well and wish to be well, or I am rich and wish to be rich, and I desire simply to have what I have--to him we shall reply: 'You, my friend, having wealth and health and strength, want to have the continuance of them; for at this moment, whether you choose or no, you have them. EOS And when you say, I desire that which I have and nothing else, is not your meaning that you want to have what you now have in the future?' EOS He must, replied Agathon. EOS Then he and every one who desires, desires that which he has not already, and which is future and not present, and which he has not, and is not, and of which he is in want;--these are the sort of things which love and desire seek? EOS Very true, he said. EOS Yes, he replied. EOS Remember further what you said in your speech, or if you do not remember I will remind you: you said that the love of the beautiful set in order the empire of the gods, for that of deformed things there is no love--did you not say something of that kind? EOS Yes, said Agathon. EOS And if this is true, Love is the love of beauty and not of deformity? EOS And the admission has been already made that Love is of something which a man wants and has not? EOS Then Love wants and has not beauty? EOS And would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess beauty? EOS Certainly not. EOS Agathon replied: I fear that I did not understand what I was saying. EOS You made a very good speech, Agathon, replied Socrates; but there is yet one small question which I would fain ask:--Is not the good also the beautiful? EOS Yes. EOS Then in wanting the beautiful, love wants also the good? EOS I cannot refute you, Socrates, said Agathon:--Let us assume that what you say is true. EOS Say rather, beloved Agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; for Socrates is easily refuted. EOS 'Hush,' she cried; 'must that be foul which is not fair?' EOS 'Certainly,' I said. EOS 'And is that which is not wise, ignorant? EOS do you not see that there is a mean between wisdom and ignorance?' EOS I said. EOS 'Right opinion,' she replied; 'which, as you know, being incapable of giving a reason, is not knowledge (for how can knowledge be devoid of reason? EOS 'Well,' I said, 'Love is surely admitted by all to be a great god.' EOS 'By those who know or by those who do not know?' EOS 'By all.' EOS 'And how, Socrates,' she said with a smile, 'can Love be acknowledged to be a great god by those who say that he is not a god at all?' EOS 'And who are they?' EOS I said. EOS 'You and I are two of them,' she replied. EOS I said. EOS 'And you mean by the happy, those who are the possessors of things good or fair?' EOS 'Yes.' EOS 'Yes, I did.' EOS 'Impossible.' EOS 'Then you see that you also deny the divinity of Love.' EOS 'What then is Love?' EOS I asked; 'Is he mortal?' EOS 'What then?' EOS 'As in the former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal, but in a mean between the two.' EOS 'What is he, Diotima?' EOS 'He is a great spirit (daimon), and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal.' EOS For God mingles not with man; but through Love all the intercourse and converse of God with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. EOS The wisdom which understands this is spiritual; all other wisdom, such as that of arts and handicrafts, is mean and vulgar. EOS Now these spirits or intermediate powers are many and diverse, and one of them is Love.' EOS 'And who,' I said, 'was his father, and who his mother?' EOS Now Plenty who was the worse for nectar (there was no wine in those days), went into the garden of Zeus and fell into a heavy sleep, and Poverty considering her own straitened circumstances, plotted to have a child by him, and accordingly she lay down at his side and conceived Love, who partly because he is naturally a lover of the beautiful, and because Aphrodite is herself beautiful, and also because he was born on her birthday, is her follower and attendant. EOS And as his parentage is, so also are his fortunes. EOS In the first place he is always poor, and anything but tender and fair, as the many imagine him; and he is rough and squalid, and has no shoes, nor a house to dwell in; on the bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven, in the streets, or at the doors of houses, taking his rest; and like his mother he is always in distress. EOS Like his father too, whom he also partly resembles, he is always plotting against the fair and good; he is bold, enterprising, strong, a mighty hunter, always weaving some intrigue or other, keen in the pursuit of wisdom, fertile in resources; a philosopher at all times, terrible as an enchanter, sorcerer, sophist. EOS He is by nature neither mortal nor immortal, but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is in plenty, and dead at another moment, and again alive by reason of his father's nature. EOS But that which is always flowing in is always flowing out, and so he is never in want and never in wealth; and, further, he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge. EOS The truth of the matter is this: No god is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom, for he is wise already; nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom. EOS Neither do the ignorant seek after wisdom. EOS For herein is the evil of ignorance, that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself: he has no desire for that of which he feels no want.' EOS 'But who then, Diotima,' I said, 'are the lovers of wisdom, if they are neither the wise nor the foolish?' EOS For wisdom is a most beautiful thing, and Love is of the beautiful; and therefore Love is also a philosopher or lover of wisdom, and being a lover of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant. EOS And of this too his birth is the cause; for his father is wealthy and wise, and his mother poor and foolish. EOS Such, my dear Socrates, is the nature of the spirit Love. EOS For the beloved is the truly beautiful, and delicate, and perfect, and blessed; but the principle of love is of another nature, and is such as I have described.' EOS I said, 'O thou stranger woman, thou sayest well; but, assuming Love to be such as you say, what is the use of him to men?' EOS 'That, Socrates,' she replied, 'I will attempt to unfold: of his nature and birth I have already spoken; and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful. EOS I answered her 'That the beautiful may be his.' EOS 'To what you have asked,' I replied, 'I have no answer ready.' EOS 'And what does he gain who possesses the good?' EOS 'Yes,' she said, 'the happy are made happy by the acquisition of good things. EOS Nor is there any need to ask why a man desires happiness; the answer is already final.' EOS and do all men always desire their own good, or only some men?--what say you?' EOS 'All men,' I replied; 'the desire is common to all.' EOS 'I myself wonder,' I said, 'why this is.' EOS 'There is nothing to wonder at,' she replied; 'the reason is that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the whole, but the other parts have other names.' EOS She answered me as follows: 'There is poetry, which, as you know, is complex and manifold. EOS All creation or passage of non-being into being is poetry or making, and the processes of all art are creative; and the masters of arts are all poets or makers.' EOS 'Very true.' EOS 'And the same holds of love. EOS 'I dare say,' I replied, 'that you are right.' EOS 'Yes,' she added, 'and you hear people say that lovers are seeking for their other half; but I say that they are seeking neither for the half of themselves, nor for the whole, unless the half or the whole be also a good. EOS Is there anything?' EOS 'Certainly, I should say, that there is nothing.' EOS 'That must be added too.' EOS 'Then love,' she said, 'may be described generally as the love of the everlasting possession of the good?' EOS 'Then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further,' she said, 'what is the manner of the pursuit? EOS what are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love? EOS and what is the object which they have in view? EOS Answer me.' EOS 'Well,' she said, 'I will teach you:--The object which they have in view is birth in beauty, whether of body or soul.' EOS 'I do not understand you,' I said; 'the oracle requires an explanation.' EOS And this is the reason why, when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full, there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail. EOS For love, Socrates, is not, as you imagine, the love of the beautiful only.' EOS 'What then?' EOS 'Yes,' I said. EOS 'Yes, indeed,' she replied. EOS 'But why of generation?' EOS See you not how all animals, birds, as well as beasts, in their desire of procreation, are in agony when they take the infection of love, which begins with the desire of union; whereto is added the care of offspring, on whose behalf the weakest are ready to battle against the strongest even to the uttermost, and to die for them, and will let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything in order to maintain their young. EOS Man may be supposed to act thus from reason; but why should animals have these passionate feelings? EOS Can you tell me why?' EOS Again I replied that I did not know. EOS 'But I have told you already, Diotima, that my ignorance is the reason why I come to you; for I am conscious that I want a teacher; tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.' EOS 'Marvel not,' she said, 'if you believe that love is of the immortal, as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same principle too, the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation, because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old. EOS Nay even in the life of the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity: a man is called the same, and yet in the short interval which elapses between youth and age, and in which every animal is said to have life and identity, he is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and reparation--hair, flesh, bones, blood, and the whole body are always changing. EOS For what is implied in the word "recollection," but the departure of knowledge, which is ever being forgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears to be the same although in reality new, according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new and similar existence behind--unlike the divine, which is always the same and not another? EOS And in this way, Socrates, the mortal body, or mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way. EOS Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality.' EOS I was astonished at her words, and said: 'Is this really true, O thou wise Diotima?' EOS They are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have run for their children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal. EOS Nay,' she said, 'I am persuaded that all men do all things, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal. EOS But souls which are pregnant--for there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls than in their bodies--conceive that which is proper for the soul to conceive or contain. EOS And what are these conceptions?--wisdom and virtue in general. EOS But the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families, and which is called temperance and justice. EOS And he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired, when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate. EOS He wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring--for in deformity he will beget nothing--and naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed body; above all when he finds a fair and noble and well-nurtured soul, he embraces the two in one person, and to such an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a good man; and he tries to educate him; and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forth that which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tends that which he brings forth; and they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal. EOS Or who would not have such children as Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours, not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas, as one may say? EOS There is Solon, too, who is the revered father of Athenian laws; and many others there are in many other places, both among Hellenes and barbarians, who have given to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtue of every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honour for the sake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honour of any one, for the sake of his mortal children. EOS 'These are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, Socrates, may enter; to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of these, and to which, if you pursue them in a right spirit, they will lead, I know not whether you will be able to attain. EOS But I will do my utmost to inform you, and do you follow if you can. EOS For he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love one such form only--out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same! EOS And when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beauty of the outward form. EOS To this I will proceed; please to give me your very best attention:  'He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who has learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comes toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (and this, Socrates, is the final cause of all our former toils)--a nature which in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, or waxing and waning; secondly, not fair in one point of view and foul in another, or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair, at another time or in another relation or at another place foul, as if fair to some and foul to others, or in the likeness of a face or hands or any other part of the bodily frame, or in any form of speech or knowledge, or existing in any other being, as for example, in an animal, or in heaven, or in earth, or in any other place; but beauty absolute, separate, simple, and everlasting, which without diminution and without increase, or any change, is imparted to the ever-growing and perishing beauties of all other things. EOS He who from these ascending under the influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty, is not far from the end. EOS This, my dear Socrates,' said the stranger of Mantineia, 'is that life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute; a beauty which if you once beheld, you would see not to be after the measure of gold, and garments, and fair boys and youths, whose presence now entrances you; and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink, if that were possible--you only want to look at them and to be with them. EOS Remember how in that communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may. EOS The words which I have spoken, you, Phaedrus, may call an encomium of love, or anything else which you please. EOS When Socrates had done speaking, the company applauded, and Aristophanes was beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which Socrates had made to his own speech, when suddenly there was a great knocking at the door of the house, as of revellers, and the sound of a flute-girl was heard. EOS Agathon told the attendants to go and see who were the intruders. EOS 'If they are friends of ours,' he said, 'invite them in, but if not, say that the drinking is over.' EOS A little while afterwards they heard the voice of Alcibiades resounding in the court; he was in a great state of intoxication, and kept roaring and shouting 'Where is Agathon? EOS 'Hail, friends,' he said, appearing at the door crowned with a massive garland of ivy and violets, his head flowing with ribands. EOS Or shall I crown Agathon, which was my intention in coming, and go away? EOS Yet I know very well that I am speaking the truth, although you may laugh. EOS The company were vociferous in begging that he would take his place among them, and Agathon specially invited him. EOS By all means; but who makes the third partner in our revels? EOS By Heracles, he said, what is this? EOS Socrates turned to Agathon and said: I must ask you to protect me, Agathon; for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious matter to me. EOS There can never be reconciliation between you and me, said Alcibiades; but for the present I will defer your chastisement. EOS And I must beg you, Agathon, to give me back some of the ribands that I may crown the marvellous head of this universal despot--I would not have him complain of me for crowning you, and neglecting him, who in conversation is the conqueror of all mankind; and this not only once, as you were the day before yesterday, but always. EOS Whereupon, taking some of the ribands, he crowned Socrates, and again reclined. EOS Then he said: You seem, my friends, to be sober, which is a thing not to be endured; you must drink--for that was the agreement under which I was admitted--and I elect myself master of the feast until you are well drunk. EOS Let us have a large goblet, Agathon, or rather, he said, addressing the attendant, bring me that wine-cooler. EOS The wine-cooler which had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than two quarts--this he filled and emptied, and bade the attendant fill it again for Socrates. EOS Socrates drank the cup which the attendant filled for him. EOS Are we to have neither conversation nor singing over our cups; but simply to drink as if we were thirsty? EOS Alcibiades replied: Hail, worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire! EOS The same to you, said Eryximachus; but what shall we do? EOS Well, said Eryximachus, before you appeared we had passed a resolution that each one of us in turn should make a speech in praise of love, and as good a one as he could: the turn was passed round from left to right; and as all of us have spoken, and you have not spoken but have well drunken, you ought to speak, and then impose upon Socrates any task which you please, and he on his right hand neighbour, and so on. EOS That is good, Eryximachus, said Alcibiades; and yet the comparison of a drunken man's speech with those of sober men is hardly fair; and I should like to know, sweet friend, whether you really believe what Socrates was just now saying; for I can assure you that the very reverse is the fact, and that if I praise any one but himself in his presence, whether God or man, he will hardly keep his hands off me. EOS For shame, said Socrates. EOS Hold your tongue, said Alcibiades, for by Poseidon, there is no one else whom I will praise when you are of the company. EOS Well then, said Eryximachus, if you like praise Socrates. EOS said Alcibiades: shall I attack him and inflict the punishment before you all? EOS said Socrates; are you going to raise a laugh at my expense? EOS Is that the meaning of your praise? EOS I am going to speak the truth, if you will permit me. EOS And now, my boys, I shall praise Socrates in a figure which will appear to him to be a caricature, and yet I speak, not to make fun of him, but only for the truth's sake. EOS I say also that he is like Marsyas the satyr. EOS Aye, and there is a resemblance in other points too. EOS For example, you are a bully, as I can prove by witnesses, if you will not confess. EOS And are you not a flute-player? EOS That you are, and a performer far more wonderful than Marsyas. EOS He indeed with instruments used to charm the souls of men by the power of his breath, and the players of his music do so still: for the melodies of Olympus (compare Arist. EOS Pol.) EOS are derived from Marsyas who taught them, and these, whether they are played by a great master or by a miserable flute-girl, have a power which no others have; they alone possess the soul and reveal the wants of those who have need of gods and mysteries, because they are divine. EOS But you produce the same effect with your words only, and do not require the flute: that is the difference between you and him. EOS When we hear any other speaker, even a very good one, he produces absolutely no effect upon us, or not much, whereas the mere fragments of you and your words, even at second-hand, and however imperfectly repeated, amaze and possess the souls of every man, woman, and child who comes within hearing of them. EOS And if I were not afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk, I would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they have always had and still have over me. EOS For my heart leaps within me more than that of any Corybantian reveller, and my eyes rain tears when I hear them. EOS And I observe that many others are affected in the same manner. EOS I have heard Pericles and other great orators, and I thought that they spoke well, but I never had any similar feeling; my soul was not stirred by them, nor was I angry at the thought of my own slavish state. EOS But this Marsyas has often brought me to such a pass, that I have felt as if I could hardly endure the life which I am leading (this, Socrates, you will admit); and I am conscious that if I did not shut my ears against him, and fly as from the voice of the siren, my fate would be like that of others,--he would transfix me, and I should grow old sitting at his feet. EOS For he makes me confess that I ought not to live as I do, neglecting the wants of my own soul, and busying myself with the concerns of the Athenians; therefore I hold my ears and tear myself away from him. EOS For I know that I cannot answer him or say that I ought not to do as he bids, but when I leave his presence the love of popularity gets the better of me. EOS And therefore I run away and fly from him, and when I see him I am ashamed of what I have confessed to him. EOS Many a time have I wished that he were dead, and yet I know that I should be much more sorry than glad, if he were to die: so that I am at my wit's end. EOS And this is what I and many others have suffered from the flute-playing of this satyr. EOS Yet hear me once more while I show you how exact the image is, and how marvellous his power. EOS For let me tell you; none of you know him; but I will reveal him to you; having begun, I must go on. EOS See you how fond he is of the fair? EOS He is always with them and is always being smitten by them, and then again he knows nothing and is ignorant of all things--such is the appearance which he puts on. EOS To be sure he is: his outer mask is the carved head of the Silenus; but, O my companions in drink, when he is opened, what temperance there is residing within! EOS In the prosecution of this design, when I next went to him, I sent away the attendant who usually accompanied me (I will confess the whole truth, and beg you to listen; and if I speak falsely, do you, Socrates, expose the falsehood). EOS Not a bit; I made no way with him. EOS Lastly, as I had failed hitherto, I thought that I must take stronger measures and attack him boldly, and, as I had begun, not give him up, but see how matters stood between him and me. EOS So I invited him to sup with me, just as if he were a fair youth, and I a designing lover. EOS The second time, still in pursuance of my design, after we had supped, I went on conversing far into the night, and when he wanted to go away, I pretended that the hour was late and that he had much better remain. EOS So he lay down on the couch next to me, the same on which he had supped, and there was no one but ourselves sleeping in the apartment. EOS All this may be told without shame to any one. EOS But what follows I could hardly tell you if I were sober. EOS Moreover I have felt the serpent's sting; and he who has suffered, as they say, is willing to tell his fellow-sufferers only, as they alone will be likely to understand him, and will not be extreme in judging of the sayings or doings which have been wrung from his agony. EOS For I have been bitten by a more than viper's tooth; I have known in my soul, or in my heart, or in some other part, that worst of pangs, more violent in ingenuous youth than any serpent's tooth, the pang of philosophy, which will make a man say or do anything. EOS And you whom I see around me, Phaedrus and Agathon and Eryximachus and Pausanias and Aristodemus and Aristophanes, all of you, and I need not say Socrates himself, have had experience of the same madness and passion in your longing after wisdom. EOS Therefore listen and excuse my doings then and my sayings now. EOS But let the attendants and other profane and unmannered persons close up the doors of their ears. EOS When the lamp was put out and the servants had gone away, I thought that I must be plain with him and have no more ambiguity. EOS 'Do you know what I am meditating? EOS 'What are you meditating?' EOS he said. EOS Now I feel that I should be a fool to refuse you this or any other favour, and therefore I come to lay at your feet all that I have and all that my friends have, in the hope that you will assist me in the way of virtue, which I desire above all things, and in which I believe that you can help me better than any one else. EOS To these words he replied in the ironical manner which is so characteristic of him:--'Alcibiades, my friend, you have indeed an elevated aim if what you say is true, and if there really is in me any power by which you may become better; truly you must see in me some rare beauty of a kind infinitely higher than any which I see in you. EOS And therefore, if you mean to share with me and to exchange beauty for beauty, you will have greatly the advantage of me; you will gain true beauty in return for appearance--like Diomede, gold in exchange for brass. EOS Hearing this, I said: 'I have told you my purpose, which is quite serious, and do you consider what you think best for you and me.' EOS 'That is good,' he said; 'at some other time then we will consider and act as seems best about this and about other matters.' EOS This again, Socrates, will not be denied by you. EOS What do you suppose must have been my feelings, after this rejection, at the thought of my own dishonour? EOS And yet I could not help wondering at his natural temperance and self-restraint and manliness. EOS I never imagined that I could have met with a man such as he is in wisdom and endurance. EOS And therefore I could not be angry with him or renounce his company, any more than I could hope to win him. EOS For I well knew that if Ajax could not be wounded by steel, much less he by money; and my only chance of captivating him by my personal attractions had failed. EOS So I was at my wit's end; no one was ever more hopelessly enslaved by another. EOS His endurance was simply marvellous when, being cut off from our supplies, we were compelled to go without food--on such occasions, which often happen in time of war, he was superior not only to me but to everybody; there was no one to be compared to him. EOS There was a severe frost, for the winter in that region is really tremendous, and everybody else either remained indoors, or if they went out had on an amazing quantity of clothes, and were well shod, and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces: in the midst of this, Socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched better than the other soldiers who had shoes, and they looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise them. EOS I have told you one tale, and now I must tell you another, which is worth hearing,  'Of the doings and sufferings of the enduring man'  while he was on the expedition. EOS One morning he was thinking about something which he could not resolve; he would not give it up, but continued thinking from early dawn until noon--there he stood fixed in thought; and at noon attention was drawn to him, and the rumour ran through the wondering crowd that Socrates had been standing and thinking about something ever since the break of day. EOS At last, in the evening after supper, some Ionians out of curiosity (I should explain that this was not in winter but in summer), brought out their mats and slept in the open air that they might watch him and see whether he would stand all night. EOS There he stood until the following morning; and with the return of light he offered up a prayer to the sun, and went his way (compare supra). EOS He and Laches were retreating, for the troops were in flight, and I met them and told them not to be discouraged, and promised to remain with them; and there you might see him, Aristophanes, as you describe (Aristoph. EOS For, although I forgot to mention this to you before, his words are like the images of Silenus which open; they are ridiculous when you first hear them; he clothes himself in language that is like the skin of the wanton satyr--for his talk is of pack-asses and smiths and cobblers and curriers, and he is always repeating the same things in the same words (compare Gorg. EOS ), so that any ignorant or inexperienced person might feel disposed to laugh at him; but he who opens the bust and sees what is within will find that they are the only words which have a meaning in them, and also the most divine, abounding in fair images of virtue, and of the widest comprehension, or rather extending to the whole duty of a good and honourable man. EOS This, friends, is my praise of Socrates. EOS But the plot of this Satyric or Silenic drama has been detected, and you must not allow him, Agathon, to set us at variance. EOS I believe you are right, said Agathon, and I am disposed to think that his intention in placing himself between you and me was only to divide us; but he shall gain nothing by that move; for I will go and lie on the couch next to you. EOS Yes, yes, replied Socrates, by all means come here and lie on the couch below me. EOS Alas, said Alcibiades, how I am fooled by this man; he is determined to get the better of me at every turn. EOS Certainly not, said Socrates, as you praised me, and I in turn ought to praise my neighbour on the right, he will be out of order in praising me again when he ought rather to be praised by me, and I must entreat you to consent to this, and not be jealous, for I have a great desire to praise the youth. EOS The usual way, said Alcibiades; where Socrates is, no one else has any chance with the fair; and now how readily has he invented a specious reason for attracting Agathon to himself. EOS Agathon arose in order that he might take his place on the couch by Socrates, when suddenly a band of revellers entered, and spoiled the order of the banquet. EOS Some one who was going out having left the door open, they had found their way in, and made themselves at home; great confusion ensued, and every one was compelled to drink large quantities of wine. EOS Socrates, having laid them to sleep, rose to depart; Aristodemus, as his manner was, following him. EOS In the evening he retired to rest at his own home.
