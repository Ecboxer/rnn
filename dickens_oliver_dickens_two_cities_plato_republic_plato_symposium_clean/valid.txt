EOS Give it a little gruel if it is.' EOS She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.' EOS But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied by none. EOS CHAPTER II  TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD  For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. EOS He was brought up by hand. EOS Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,' or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. EOS Oliver Twist's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference. EOS --My heart alive! EOS Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. EOS 'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. EOS It's gin.' EOS 'I couldn't see 'em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.' EOS 'I shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. EOS (He drew it towards him.) EOS interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron. EOS This was a T,--Twist, I named _him_. EOS I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.' EOS 'Will you go along with me, Oliver?' EOS 'Will she go with me?' EOS inquired poor Oliver. EOS It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes. EOS At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face. EOS Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry. EOS You know you're an orphan, I suppose?' EOS But he hadn't, because nobody had taught him. EOS For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep. EOS With this view, they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays. EOS He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him. EOS Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. EOS said the master at length, in a faint voice. EOS 'Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly. EOS As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example. EOS Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him. EOS 'That's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make 'em come down again,' said Gamfield; 'that's all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain't o' no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that's wot he likes. EOS As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. EOS said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door. EOS 'No,' replied Mr. Limbkins; 'at least, as it's a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.' EOS 'Ten shillings too much,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS said Gamfield; 'say four pound, gen'l'men. EOS 'Not a farthing more,' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins. EOS 'You're desperate hard upon me, gen'l'men,' said Gamfield, wavering. EOS 'Pooh! EOS said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS He wants the stick, now and then: it'll do him good; and his board needn't come very expensive, for he hasn't been overfed since he was born. EOS Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself. EOS Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon. EOS In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt. EOS At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way. EOS 'Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,' said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. EOS 'You're a going to be made a 'prentice of, Oliver.' EOS At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud:  'Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.' EOS As Mr. Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, 'Mind what I told you, you young rascal!' EOS He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account. EOS 'He doats on it, your worship,' replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn't. EOS The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect. EOS 'Stand a little away from him, Beadle,' said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. EOS 'Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid.' EOS Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room--that they would starve him--beat him--kill him if they pleased--rather than send him away with that dreadful man. EOS 'Well!' EOS The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his companion, he nodded significantly. EOS 'We refuse to sanction these indentures,' said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke. EOS He seems to want it.' EOS Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description. EOS Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.' EOS 'Well, well,' said Mr. Bumble, 'every trade has its drawbacks. EOS 'Just so,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel of his official coat; 'that's just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about. EOS 'Yes, I think it rather pretty,' said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. EOS 'The jury brought it in, "Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life," didn't they?' EOS Foolery!' EOS 'They haven't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than that,' said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously. EOS 'So do I,' rejoined the undertaker. EOS 'Well?' EOS Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance. EOS The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. EOS As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage. EOS cried the child. EOS Oliver bowed again. EOS There's no denying it. EOS I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they're worth. EOS There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative. EOS You don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? EOS Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress. EOS Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance. EOS When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began. EOS 'I will, directly, sir,' replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key. EOS inquired the voice. EOS 'Then I'll whop yer when I get in,' said the voice; 'you just see if I don't, that's all, my work'us brat!' EOS For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity. EOS 'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; 'did you knock?' EOS At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way. EOS With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit. EOS Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. EOS D'ye hear?' EOS said Noah Claypole. EOS said Charlotte, 'what a rum creature you are! EOS 'Let him alone!' EOS Eh, Charlotte? EOS He! EOS This affords charming food for contemplation. EOS Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a month. EOS 'Ugh, you brute!' EOS I was only going to say--'  'Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say,' interposed Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. EOS 'It's only about young Twist, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry. EOS Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment. EOS You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.' EOS Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband's mind before? EOS Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required. EOS 'Well,' said the undertaker, 'I ne--ver--did--'  'Never did, sir!' EOS Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop. EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice. EOS He needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome. EOS Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body. EOS There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. EOS The old woman's face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing. EOS Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. EOS 'Nobody shall go near her,' said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. EOS 'Nonsense, my good man,' said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes. EOS 'I tell you,' said the man:  clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,--'I tell you I won't have her put into the ground. EOS I say she was starved to death. EOS When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death. EOS Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker. EOS Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could. EOS At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave. EOS The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon. EOS The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways. EOS For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. EOS 'There; that's enough. EOS And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion. EOS But yer must know, Work'us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad 'un.' EOS blubbered Noah. EOS 'Charlotte! EOS Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down. EOS 'Oh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!' EOS When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up. EOS This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears. EOS 'A glass of water, Noah, dear. EOS 'Oh! EOS Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!' EOS I only hope this'll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. EOS Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some affecting tears and sniffs. EOS You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. EOS Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment. EOS Bumble!' EOS interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes. EOS 'Not run away; he hasn't run away, has he, Noah?' EOS 'By Jove!' EOS added Mr. Bumble. EOS Don't spare him, Bumble.' EOS And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner's satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker's shop. EOS The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. EOS 'Ain't you afraid of it, sir? EOS 'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. EOS What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? EOS said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; 'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. EOS Sowerberry returned at this juncture. EOS Oliver's offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar. EOS The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed. EOS For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed. EOS The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. EOS He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill. EOS How pale you are!' EOS 'I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,' replied the child with a faint smile. EOS 'I shall see you again, Dick. EOS 'After I am dead, but not before. EOS As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward. EOS Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. EOS He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. EOS Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. EOS What's the row?' EOS 'My eyes, how green!' EOS 'What mill?' EOS Up with you on your pins. EOS 'Morrice!' EOS 'Got any lodgings?' EOS Oh, no! EOS By no means. EOS A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. EOS There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. EOS 'There's two on you,' said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand. EOS 'Where did he come from?' EOS 'Greenland. EOS Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men. EOS Ha! EOS There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. EOS Oliver was precisely in this condition. EOS He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. EOS Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels. EOS said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin. EOS No, no, no! EOS At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names. EOS Five of 'em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white-livered!' EOS 'What's that?' EOS Ha! EOS The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding. EOS 'Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?' EOS The folks call me a miser, my dear. EOS Only a miser; that's all.' EOS Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher. EOS 'Pretty well,' replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one green, and the other red. EOS 'Very indeed, sir,' said Oliver. EOS 'And what have you got, my dear?' EOS ha! EOS ha!' EOS At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. EOS If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again. EOS When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy. EOS Make 'em your models, my dear. EOS cried the Jew. EOS 'Here it is, sir,' said Oliver, showing it in his hand. EOS 'You're a clever boy, my dear,' said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. EOS BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY  For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. EOS replied the Dodger. EOS said Oliver. EOS It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness. EOS too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens. EOS The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. EOS One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy. EOS 'Yes,' said the gentleman, 'I am afraid it is the boy.' EOS 'That's a good 'un!' EOS 'Oh no, I won't hurt him,' replied the officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof. EOS Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace. EOS inquired the man with the keys. EOS It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night. EOS He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. EOS The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. EOS He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned. EOS 'Officer!' EOS 'Who is this fellow?' EOS 'He's not charged at all, your worship,' replied the officer. EOS 'He appears against this boy, your worship.' EOS 'Swear him!' EOS How dare you bully a magistrate!' EOS said Fang to the clerk. EOS 'I'll not hear another word. EOS Mr. Brownlow's indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once. EOS What have you got to say, sir?' EOS 'Hold your tongue, sir,' said Mr. Fang. EOS 'Policeman! EOS The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it. EOS Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I'll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by--'  By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard--accidently, of course. EOS 'And I fear,' he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, 'I really fear that he is ill.'  'Oh! EOS demanded Mr. Fang. EOS 'Officer, what's his name?' EOS He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess. EOS 'Has he any parents?' EOS said Mr. Fang:  'don't try to make a fool of me.' EOS don't take him away! EOS cried the new comer, breathless with haste. EOS Turn this man out. EOS I saw it all. EOS I will not be put down. EOS I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.' EOS said Fang, after a pause. EOS 'Dear me, I forgot all about it!' EOS Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. EOS Dear, dear! EOS Poor fellow! EOS But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. EOS 'Hush, my dear,' said the old lady softly. EOS said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. EOS 'Perhaps she does see me,' whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; 'perhaps she has sat by me. EOS 'That was the fever, my dear,' said the old lady mildly. EOS He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better. EOS 'No, sir,' answered Oliver. EOS The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself. EOS Don't keep him too warm, ma'am; but be careful that you don't let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?' EOS These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again. EOS And thus the night crept slowly on. EOS The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy's mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven. EOS In three days' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which belonged to her. EOS 'You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,' said Oliver. EOS said Oliver. EOS 'Yes,' said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; 'that's a portrait.' EOS 'It's not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect. EOS said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; 'you don't see it now, at all events.' EOS Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. EOS 'Poor boy, poor boy!' EOS I'm afraid I have caught cold.' EOS 'I don't know, Bedwin. EOS said the old gentleman. EOS 'Some mistake,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'I hope you are not angry with me, sir?' EOS said Oliver, raising his eyes beseechingly. EOS The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same. EOS For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex. EOS ha! EOS 'What?' EOS inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive. EOS Master Bates felt it so; and again said, 'What do you mean?' EOS muttered the Jew:  changing countenance; 'only two of 'em? EOS Where's the third? EOS said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. EOS 'Where's the boy?' EOS But they made no reply. EOS 'Come, let go o' me, will you!' EOS The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant's head. EOS It's well it's the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I'd have settled somebody. EOS The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;--the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them. EOS He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days' growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow. EOS said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys. EOS He then, in cant terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor. EOS 'You're blowed upon, Fagin.' EOS There was a long pause. EOS The Jew nodded assent. EOS This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever. EOS inquired the young lady. EOS 'Nancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a soothing manner, 'what do YOU say?' EOS 'What do you mean by that?' EOS said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner. EOS 'And as I don't want 'em to, neither,' replied Nancy in the same composed manner, 'it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.' EOS 'Ah, she's a clever girl, my dears,' said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld. EOS 'Here's her health, and wishing they was all like her!' EOS murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; 'Nolly?' EOS He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county:  so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there. EOS I shall shut up this shop to-night. EOS Not an instant, my dears!' EOS 'Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?' EOS Find him, find him out, that's all. EOS 'He has not peached so far,' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation. EOS 'Ah!' EOS It didn't worry me, ma'am,' said Oliver. EOS 'There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?' EOS 'You shall read them, if you behave well,' said the old gentleman kindly; 'and you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.' EOS 'Now,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, 'I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say. EOS 'Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again. EOS The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections. EOS Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.' EOS inquired Mr. Brownlow. EOS inquired Oliver. EOS At this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself by a thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green. EOS I've been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I'll be content to eat my own head, sir!' EOS 'I'll eat my head, sir,' repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground. EOS what's that!' EOS looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two. EOS Oliver bowed. EOS If that's not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I'll eat my head, and his too.' EOS Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.' EOS A man-trap!" EOS 'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor's manner, he was very happy to do. EOS 'He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?' EOS 'Don't know?' EOS 'No. EOS 'He may have worse.' EOS 'He may have worse, I say,' repeated Mr. Grimwig. EOS Pooh! EOS When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously. EOS And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn't find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to--and so forth. EOS asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject. EOS 'I would rather he was alone with me at the time. EOS 'Send Oliver with them,' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; 'he will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.' EOS This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.' EOS The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room. EOS 'Oh! EOS The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket. EOS Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots. EOS Come here! EOS This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. EOS There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. EOS 'Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,' replied the Jew. EOS 'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,' replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; 'that's why.' EOS You'll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it's behind a nightcap. EOS There! EOS If I go, you go; so take care of me.' EOS 'You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?' EOS Jerk the tinkler.' EOS The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person. EOS 'Is anybody here, Barney?' EOS 'Dot a shoul,' replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came from the heart or not:  made their way through the nose. EOS 'Nobody?' EOS 'Dobody but Biss Dadsy,' replied Barney. EOS exclaimed Sikes. EOS 'She's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,' replied Barney. EOS Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete. EOS inquired Sikes, proffering the glass. EOS The young brat's been ill and confined to the crib; and--'  'Ah, Nancy, dear!' EOS said Fagin, looking up. EOS Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. EOS Who is it? EOS The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her hand. EOS Thank gracious goodness heavins, I've found him!' EOS To which, the butcher's boy:  who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition:  replied, that he thought not. EOS 'Oh, no, no, never mind,' said the young woman, grasping Oliver's hand; 'I'm better now. EOS 'Oh, ma'am,' replied the young woman, 'he ran away, near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother's heart.' EOS said one woman. EOS 'I don't know her. EOS I haven't any sister, or father and mother either. EOS 'Only hear him, how he braves it out!' EOS 'You see he knows me!' EOS cried Oliver, struggling in the man's powerful grasp. EOS repeated the man. EOS 'That's right!' EOS It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain. EOS Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy's hand. EOS They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers. EOS Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. EOS 'Give me the other,' said Sikes, seizing Oliver's unoccupied hand. EOS 'What's the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can't I!' EOS 'Of course they can,' replied Sikes. EOS 'It was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't hear the squeaking on. EOS said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. EOS 'Oh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!' EOS 'And what good would that do?' EOS inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes. EOS At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many years. EOS They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door. EOS 'Is the old 'un here?' EOS Won't he be glad to see you? EOS 'Let's have a glim,' said Sikes, 'or we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. EOS Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy. EOS 'Look at his togs! EOS Oh, my eye, what a game! EOS 'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,' said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. EOS said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; 'mine and Nancy's that is; I'll take the boy back again.' EOS 'Fair, or not fair,' retorted Sikes, 'hand over, I tell you! EOS 'They're very pretty,' said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; 'beautiful writing, isn't is, Oliver?' EOS Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money. EOS 'Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against the wall.' EOS 'I don't care for that, Bill, I don't care for that,' screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, 'the child shan't be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.' EOS 'No, she hasn't,' said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; 'no, she hasn't, Fagin; don't think it.' EOS 'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?' EOS Oliver made no reply. EOS But he watched the Jew's motions, and breathed quickly. EOS 'Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?' EOS Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention. EOS said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: 'what do you mean by it? EOS He's a thief, a liar, a devil, all that's bad, from this night forth. EOS 'Civil words!' EOS cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. EOS I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!' EOS 'Well, well,' replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; 'and, if you have, it's your living!' EOS returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream. EOS The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business. EOS Charley, show Oliver to bed.' EOS inquired Charley Bates. EOS Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! EOS Mann.' EOS Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed. EOS 'Ah! EOS 'Oh! EOS 'Here, you Dick!' EOS Having had his face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle. EOS said Mrs. Mann. EOS That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!' EOS 'I never see such a hardened little wretch!' EOS 'Take him away, ma'am!' EOS said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically. EOS He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on. EOS The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the following advertisement. EOS 'FIVE GUINEAS REWARD  'Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of. EOS 'Is Mr. Brownlow at home?' EOS inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door. EOS The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:  'A beadle. EOS 'Pray don't interrupt just now,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town. EOS We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.' EOS 'You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying story-books,' growled Mr. Grimwig. EOS 'I knew it all along. EOS CHAPTER XVIII  HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS  About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. EOS It was a very dirty place. EOS With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned. EOS Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver's observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,--which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul's Cathedral. EOS So's Sikes. EOS exclaimed the Dodger. EOS Would you go and be dependent on your friends?' EOS said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, 'that's too mean; that is.' EOS 'You can leave your friends, though,' said Oliver with a half smile; 'and let them be punished for what you did.' EOS 'That,' rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, 'That was all out of consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn't made our lucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Charley?' EOS Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes. EOS 'You've been brought up bad,' said the Dodger, surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. EOS You'd better begin at once; for you'll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you're only losing time, Oliver.' EOS said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver. EOS ha! EOS ha! EOS He understands the catechism of his trade.' EOS The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance. EOS He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. EOS His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his 'time' was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes. EOS Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County. EOS 'He's in luck, then,' said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin. EOS At this sally, the boys laughed. EOS At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two. EOS Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose. EOS Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever. EOS The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields. EOS He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. EOS A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's voice demanded who was there. EOS said Sikes. EOS 'It is cold, Nancy dear,' said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire. EOS 'Give him something to drink, Nancy. EOS 'There,' said Sikes, smacking his lips. EOS Somebody will hear us.' EOS 'Not to be done at all!' EOS echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair. EOS 'Then it hasn't been properly gone about,' said the Jew, turning pale with anger. EOS 'He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,' said the Jew. EOS 'So he did,' rejoined Sikes, 'and they warn't of no more use than the other plant.' EOS Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed. EOS 'Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself. EOS 'Umph!' EOS 'Oh! EOS And so they go on,' said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, 'so they go on; and, if they'd got money enough (which it's a Providence they haven't,) we shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.' EOS he asked at length. EOS 'I didn't know whether she mightn't p'r'aps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,' replied the Jew. EOS 'Never say die!' EOS and the like. EOS 'Ha! EOS you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!' EOS ha!' EOS 'What about him?' EOS demanded Sikes. EOS exclaimed Sikes. EOS 'Have him, Bill!' EOS 'I would, if I was in your place. EOS Depend upon it he's a safe one, Bill.' EOS Think of that, before you send him. EOS It couldn't have come about better! EOS 'Mine, if you like, Bill.' EOS 'I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,' rejoined Sikes in a surly voice, 'if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.' EOS 'It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?' EOS You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night. EOS 'Hours ago,' replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. EOS The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed. EOS 'I suppose,' said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, 'you want to know what you're going to Bill's for---eh, my dear?' EOS 'Indeed I don't know, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS He had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night:  when he prepared to go abroad. EOS The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went. EOS Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume. EOS By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt. EOS 'Me. EOS asked Oliver, recoiling. EOS 'I don't believe it,' said Oliver:  who had watched her closely. EOS I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. EOS You are hedged round and round. EOS 'I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do now,' continued the girl aloud; 'for those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me. EOS I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.' EOS She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. EOS All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew's steps had been directed on the previous evening. EOS But the girl's voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it. EOS 'This way,' said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time. EOS 'Oh! EOS 'Did he come quiet?' EOS Come here, young 'un; and let me read you a lectur', which is as well got over at once.' EOS 'This is powder; that 'ere's a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin'.' EOS 'As near as I know, there isn't anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn't take this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn't for your own good. EOS D'ye hear me?' EOS 'The short and the long of what you mean,' said Nancy:  speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words:  'is, that if you're crossed by him in this job you have on hand, you'll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.' EOS And now that he's thoroughly up to it, let's have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.' EOS In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of 'jemmies' being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession. EOS Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal. EOS The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing. EOS There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty. EOS Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. EOS Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement. EOS It was market-morning. EOS The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. EOS 'Yes; he's my boy,' replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was. EOS Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey. EOS They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further. EOS 'Yes, I am,' replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or better, as the case might be--for drinking; 'and not slow about it neither. EOS he's a good 'un!' EOS 'I say!' EOS The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand:  and declared he was a real good fellow. EOS After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start. EOS The night was very dark. EOS A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. EOS Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation. EOS Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. EOS thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. EOS The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together. EOS A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle:  and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill. EOS or I shall tread upon your heels.' EOS Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe. EOS 'Bill, my boy!' EOS I was almost afraid you'd given it up:  in which case I should have made a personal wentur. EOS replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire. EOS 'Down with it, innocence.' EOS 'Do you think I don't know what's good for you? EOS 'Barkers for me, Barney,' said Toby Crackit. EOS replied Toby, stowing them away. EOS 'Look out, Barney.' EOS They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey. EOS pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. EOS He's game enough now, I'll engage. EOS Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise. EOS There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em:  which is the old lady's arms.' EOS 'Keep quiet, can't you?' EOS ha! EOS So neat!' EOS Sikes, pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant. EOS whispered the other man. EOS 'Nothing,' said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. EOS 'Come back!' EOS The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes--a flash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he knew not,--and he staggered back. EOS 'Give me a shawl here. EOS The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney's hand. EOS What use is it of, to anybody! EOS The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered. EOS Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain. EOS It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards. EOS 'At your service, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other. EOS The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors. EOS We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.' EOS said the matron, sipping her tea. EOS Not a copper farthing's worth of it! EOS 'I never,' said Mr. Bumble, 'see anything like the pitch it's got to. EOS says the vagrant. EOS interposed the matron. EOS 'Mrs. EOS Corney,' said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, 'out-of-door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma'am: is the porochial safeguard. EOS This is the port wine, ma'am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!' EOS 'It blows, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar, 'enough to cut one's ears off.' EOS Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled. EOS 'Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble. EOS He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment. EOS remonstrated Mrs. Corney. EOS said Mr. Bumble. EOS Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated. EOS Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble's arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea. EOS 'Dear me!' EOS cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, 'Mr. EOS 'Well, what's that to me?' EOS She'll never die quiet till you come, mistress.' EOS Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature's hand. EOS The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay. EOS 'You should get better coals out of your contractors,' said the apothecary's deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; 'these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.' EOS said the young mag, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, 'it's all U.P. EOS Corney.' EOS 'It is, is it, sir?' EOS 'Then perhaps she'll go off in that way, if you don't make a row,' said the young man. EOS She won't see it there.' EOS The attendant did as she was told:  shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned. EOS He'll be here soon enough for us all.' EOS 'Long or short,' said the matron, snappishly, 'she won't find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing. EOS She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her to look round. EOS said the woman, struggling. EOS 'I _will_ tell her! EOS she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head--'I robbed her, so I did! EOS replied the woman, laying her hand over the other's mouth. EOS 'The only thing she had. EOS 'The boy grew so like his mother,' said the woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question, 'that I could never forget it when I saw his face. EOS poor girl! EOS Wait; there's more to tell. EOS 'No, no,' replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman. EOS CHAPTER XXV  WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY  While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire. EOS It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days. EOS cried Charley. EOS 'Try 'em again, Tom; try 'em again.' EOS 'No more of it for me, thank 'ee, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I've had enough. EOS 'How precious dull you are, Tommy!' EOS 'What do _you_ say, Charley?' EOS here's a merry-go-rounder! EOS Tommy Chitling's in love! EOS 'Betsy's a fine girl. EOS Stick up to her.' EOS Who'll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?' EOS 'A word from me would have done it; wouldn't it, Fagin?' EOS After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously. EOS he asked. EOS Scarce, scarce!' EOS To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation. EOS At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain. EOS 'Mean!' EOS Where are they hiding? EOS 'Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. EOS We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. EOS said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew's inquiry after his health. EOS The Jew nodded. EOS inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance. EOS I don't mind if I have a drop there with you!' EOS They'll be delighted, every one of 'em.' EOS He's all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. EOS As he is not here, to-morrow will be time enough.' EOS 'Ah! EOS He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes's residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot. EOS She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit's story. EOS 'The child,' said the girl, suddenly looking up, 'is better where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.' EOS 'You're drunk.' EOS 'No!' EOS rejoined the Jew, furiously. EOS exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion's unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, 'I _will_ change it! EOS Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull's throat between my fingers now. EOS You put me up for a minute; but now I'm stupid again.' EOS 'I have been lingering here these two hours. EOS 'Well; and what's come of it?' EOS 'Nothing good,' said the Jew. EOS 'Make haste!' EOS Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs. EOS Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. EOS 'Whose turn would that have served, my dear?' EOS '_That_ was not my doing,' observed Monks. EOS 'No, no, my dear!' EOS I know what these girls are, Monks, well. EOS If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if--if--' said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,--'it's not likely, mind,--but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead--'  'It's no fault of mine if he is!' EOS Anything but his death, I told you from the first. EOS 'What!' EOS 'Where?' EOS replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. EOS I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!' EOS They listened intently:  a profound silence reigned throughout the house. EOS 'It's your fancy,' said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion. EOS 'It was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.' EOS 'Besides ourselves, there's not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they're safe enough. EOS See here!' EOS His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination. EOS Has anything happened, ma'am? EOS said the lady, shuddering. EOS 'I couldn't,--oh! EOS Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose. EOS 'Another room, and this, ma'am, would be a complete thing.' EOS Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney's face. EOS 'The board allows you coals, don't they, Mrs. EOS The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. EOS What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!' EOS 'One more,' pursued the beadle; 'compose your darling feelings for only one more. EOS 'If I thought it was,' continued Mr. Bumble; 'if I thought as any one of 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--'  'They wouldn't have dared to do it, love,' responded the lady. EOS 'Have another,' said Charlotte. EOS Come here, Charlotte, and I'll kiss yer.' EOS said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. EOS Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror. EOS cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. EOS cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands. EOS 'I wish I was among some of you; you'd howl the hoarser for it.' EOS 'Stop!' EOS With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. EOS 'My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,' said the fattest man of the party, 'that we 'mediately go home again.' EOS 'You are,' said Giles. EOS By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. EOS The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes. EOS He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. EOS Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly. EOS He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him. EOS Flight! EOS But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest. EOS I'll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat," I says, "may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it."' EOS "Brittles," I says, when I had woke him, "don't be frightened!"' EOS 'I should have died at once, I'm sure, if it had been me,' observed the housemaid. EOS Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other's shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion. EOS Wounded, miss! EOS whispered the voice from the stair-head. EOS 'Not one little peep, miss?' EOS The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. EOS The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God's good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers. EOS 'He is always slow,' remarked the old lady. EOS to be sure,' replied the doctor, 'so there is. EOS A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above. EOS 'He is not in danger, I hope?' EOS 'Humph!' EOS Have you any objection to see him in my presence?' EOS 'If it be necessary,' replied the old lady, 'certainly not.' EOS Allow me--Miss Rose, will you permit me? EOS Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!' EOS Let me first see that he is in visiting order.' EOS Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed. EOS 'Vice,' said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, 'takes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her?' EOS 'But at so early an age!' EOS 'Oh, no!' EOS 'No, surely,' said the old lady; 'my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! EOS 'Then my aunt invests you with full power,' said Rose, smiling through her tears; 'but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.' EOS said the doctor. EOS 'He cannot be hardened in vice,' said Rose; 'It is impossible.' EOS The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. EOS The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles. EOS The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it. EOS 'How is the patient to-night, sir?' EOS 'Lord bless me, sir!' EOS Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? EOS Here's a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him--by doing which, they place his life in great danger--and swear he is the thief. EOS cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved. EOS Have you got a coach 'us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?' EOS This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door. EOS 'And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?' EOS 'Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?' EOS 'What he says is quite correct,' observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. EOS Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. EOS demanded Rose. EOS 'No,' replied the doctor; 'of course not! EOS I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.' EOS why did they send for these people?' EOS 'Why, indeed!' EOS 'And what the devil's a put-up thing?' EOS 'We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,' said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's, 'when the servants is in it.' EOS 'More likely on that wery account,' said Duff. EOS 'We find it was a town hand,' said Blathers, continuing his report; 'for the style of work is first-rate.' EOS 'There was two of 'em in it,' continued Blathers; 'and they had a boy with 'em; that's plain from the size of the window. EOS said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him. EOS 'Oh! EOS 'You shall have it immediately, if you will.' EOS 'Why, thank you, miss!' EOS 'It's a cold ride from London, ma'am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.' EOS While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room. EOS 'Get out!' EOS Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? EOS He warn't one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window:  which was only a story high. EOS Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. EOS Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, "Thieves!" EOS inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story. EOS said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together. EOS 'They--they certainly had a boy.' EOS replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner. EOS 'I couldn't swear to him.' EOS 'I don't think it is the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it isn't. EOS You know it can't be.' EOS inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor. EOS Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn't know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty. EOS But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul. EOS 'The trouble!' EOS 'You will make me happier than I can tell you,' replied the young lady. EOS cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. EOS When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation. EOS 'What's the matter with the boy?' EOS 'That house!' EOS Pull up here,' cried the doctor. EOS 'Halloa?' EOS Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? EOS 'What do you want, then?' EOS demanded the hunchback. EOS 'I am an ass!' EOS 'Then don't forget it another time.' EOS 'Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? EOS And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business. EOS He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth. EOS As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither. EOS 'Now, my boy, which house is it?' EOS inquired Mr. Losberne. EOS 'They were so good to me; so very, very good to me.' EOS It went on a few paces, and stopped again. EOS Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face. EOS inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment's pause. EOS 'The old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow's, all went together.' EOS said Oliver. EOS 'I know the way there. EOS See him, pray, sir! EOS Do see him!' EOS And in obedience to the doctor's impulse, home they went. EOS The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber--a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day--was almost more than he could bear. EOS Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! EOS Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there. EOS The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours. EOS Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest. EOS There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture. EOS 'No, no! EOS I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.' EOS She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. EOS I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps. EOS It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.' EOS God forbid!' EOS Heaven will never let her die so young.' EOS said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver's head. EOS I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. EOS 'We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; 'this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne. EOS Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once. EOS Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work:  nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town. EOS At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes. EOS As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart. EOS 'Death!' EOS Grind him to ashes! EOS He'd start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!' EOS How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred! EOS And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge! EOS Oh! EOS the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them! EOS It was tolling for the funeral service. EOS He had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been. EOS We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired! EOS Oliver's heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away. EOS 'You must compose yourself,' said the doctor supporting her. EOS 'No!' EOS 'Oliver, what's the news? EOS Miss Rose! EOS Master O-li-ver!' EOS 'You are sure?' EOS 'The change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.' EOS It wouldn't be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.' EOS Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise. EOS whispered the young man; 'why did you not write before?' EOS 'Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?' EOS And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.' EOS 'And ever will!' EOS said the young man. EOS I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind. EOS 'Let it rest with Rose, then,' interposed Harry. EOS 'I must go back to her. EOS said Harry. EOS 'And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her. EOS 'No,' said the old lady; 'I will tell her all.' EOS And pressing her son's hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room. EOS The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears. EOS 'None at all, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity. EOS 'Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour. EOS Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. EOS The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. EOS The window of the young lady's chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning. EOS Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning's walk. EOS There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive. EOS 'He!' EOS And keep as near me, as you can.' EOS So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him. EOS The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it. EOS She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed. EOS 'Forgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.' EOS that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.' EOS Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you--these were distractions almost too great to bear. EOS You recovered. EOS I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection. EOS 'Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.' EOS 'You can say nothing to alter my resolution. EOS 'Yes, Harry. EOS 'Say but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!' EOS 'Stay!' EOS Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness. EOS 'The prospect before you,' answered Rose, firmly, 'is a brilliant one. EOS But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother's place. EOS 'No,' said Harry; 'to hear you repeat it, if you will--finally repeat it! EOS Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?' EOS 'I should like to know how--how my mother and Miss Maylie are,' said the young man; 'and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she--they, I mean--seem happy and quite well. EOS Do you hear?' EOS Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life. EOS The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one. EOS Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle. EOS There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them. EOS said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. EOS Bumble, ma'am!' EOS 'Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?' EOS 'I said the word, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased. EOS 'Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now. EOS I wish he was, poor man!' EOS Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him. EOS 'So cry away.' EOS As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance. EOS This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities. EOS The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office. EOS hallo there! EOS '_You_ thought they were talking too much?' EOS 'I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,' returned his lady. EOS You're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don't concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day. EOS Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person. EOS It wanted but this. EOS He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery. EOS Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street. EOS This determined him. EOS Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street. EOS He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance. EOS 'Were you looking for me,' he said, 'when you peered in at the window?' EOS 'Not that I am aware of, unless you're Mr.--'  Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank. EOS You don't know it. EOS 'You were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again. EOS 'Master of the workhouse,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume. EOS 'Master of the workhouse, young man!' EOS 'You understand what that means, landlord!' EOS When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:  'Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.' EOS 'It's a long time,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Yes.' EOS 'A many boys,' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly. EOS 'Why, you mean Oliver! EOS Where is she?' EOS said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious. EOS There's no midwifery there, whichever place she's gone to; so I suppose she's out of employment, anyway.' EOS said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence. EOS 'At nine in the evening,' said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; 'at nine in the evening, bring her to me there. EOS The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it. EOS 'What name am I to ask for?' EOS They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation. EOS 'The place should be somewhere here,' said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand. EOS 'Halloa there!' EOS Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story. EOS 'Is that the man?' EOS asked Mr. Bumble's good lady. EOS With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground. EOS demanded Monks. EOS Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it. EOS He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured. EOS Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling:  and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it. EOS asked Monks. EOS 'Five-and-twenty pounds!' EOS cried Monks impatiently; 'and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!' EOS 'What if I pay it for nothing?' EOS Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd:  I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear:  that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I'm once roused. EOS As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose. EOS 'He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can't speak in a lower tone,' said Monks, grimly. EOS He's your husband, eh?' EOS 'He my husband!' EOS tittered the matron, parrying the question. EOS I'm in earnest. EOS asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; 'No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? EOS 'In death,' replied the woman, with something like a shudder. EOS To whom? EOS How long before?' EOS 'Without saying more?' EOS 'It's a lie! EOS I'll tear the life out of you both, but I'll know what it was.' EOS 'She didn't utter another word,' said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man's violence; 'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.' EOS 'Which contained--' interposed Monks, stretching forward. EOS 'Nothing,' replied the woman; 'it was a pawnbroker's duplicate.' EOS '_There_,' replied the woman. EOS 'And this is all?' EOS 'All,' replied the woman. EOS 'Is that what you expected to get from me?' EOS Can it be used against me?' EOS There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course. EOS It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone. EOS It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. EOS Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes's question. EOS 'Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.' EOS 'Oh! EOS 'Why, you don't mean to say, you'd be hard upon me to-night, Bill,' said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder. EOS cried Mr. Sikes. EOS 'Why not?' EOS Why, damme, now, the girls's whining again!' EOS It'll soon be over.' EOS Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance. EOS 'Ah!' EOS exclaimed Mr. Sikes; 'I might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you'd have done anything to help me. EOS 'The things is well enough in their way,' observed Mr. Sikes:  a little soothed as he glanced over the table; 'but what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that 'ere dog.--Drive him down, Charley!' EOS 'Hold your din,' cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily. EOS 'What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?' EOS 'And what about the other fortnight?' EOS demanded Sikes. EOS 'No! EOS 'Well, well,' said Fagin, with a sigh, 'I'll send the Artful round presently.' EOS 'Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!' EOS 'And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an't he, Fagin?' EOS ha! EOS he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; 'who's that? EOS The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time. EOS 'And--and--good?' EOS Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story. EOS The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending. EOS Let me get back; that's a dear.' EOS 'Why, burn my body!' EOS 'What is it? EOS 'There ain't,' said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; 'there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd have cut her throat three months ago. EOS She's got the fever coming on; that's it.' EOS Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. EOS The girl obeyed. EOS The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance. EOS She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house. EOS A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare. EOS The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. EOS It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. EOS The porter's seat was vacant. EOS 'A lady!' EOS 'No, nor that neither,' rejoined the girl. EOS Isn't there anybody here,' she said, looking round, 'that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?' EOS said this person. EOS 'What's the good?' EOS The man ran upstairs. EOS with which the Dianas concluded. EOS Here he left her, and retired. EOS CHAPTER XL  A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER  The girl's life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman's original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview. EOS 'Let me stand, lady,' said the girl, still weeping, 'and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better. EOS It is growing late. EOS said Rose Maylie. EOS said Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion. EOS said Rose, in a broken voice. EOS rejoined the girl. EOS But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard. EOS 'He knows you,' replied the girl; 'and knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.' EOS 'I never heard the name,' said Rose. EOS Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door. EOS 'The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,' replied the girl. EOS exclaimed Rose. EOS 'You do not mean,' said Rose, turning very pale, 'to tell me that this was said in earnest?' EOS I must get back quickly.' EOS Back! EOS Oh!' EOS asked Rose. EOS It is madness.' EOS 'I promise you solemnly,' answered Rose. EOS They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. EOS These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject. EOS 'If it be painful to him,' she thought, 'to come back here, how painful it will be to me! EOS To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!' EOS 'But what is this?--of whom do you speak?' EOS Oh, dear me, dear me! EOS With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand. EOS She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account. EOS 'Dear me,' said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, 'I beg your pardon, young lady--I imagined it was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse me. EOS 'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,' said Rose, naturally embarrassed; 'but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.' EOS 'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied Rose. EOS The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach. EOS 'He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'And he'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,' responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor. EOS said the old gentleman. EOS But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie. EOS 'At this door!' EOS With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word. EOS When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time. EOS 'Hush!' EOS Ah! EOS If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.' EOS I don't think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings. EOS 'That lady's son, and this young lady's--very old friend,' said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece. EOS Come! EOS With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her into the supper-room. EOS Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up. EOS This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head:  as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion. EOS Not near; so don't think it.' EOS 'No! EOS This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole's habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her:  which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape. EOS Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John's Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray's Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London. EOS 'So give us the bundle,' said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman's shoulders, and slinging it over his own; 'and don't yer speak, except when yer spoke to. EOS Keep close at my heels, and come along.' EOS 'Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?' EOS 'Ah! EOS Ad rub uds too,' added Barney. EOS 'Frob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I'b bistaked.' EOS He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively:  with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin. EOS 'I should like that well enough, dear,' replied Charlotte; 'but tills ain't to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.' EOS said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter. EOS 'They'll be able to make us useful some way or another. EOS He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him. EOS 'Ha! EOS However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner. EOS Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror. EOS 'Ha! EOS ha! EOS asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering. EOS There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. EOS 'Here! EOS Let me have a word with you outside.' EOS 'But, I say, she'll be back if yer lose time.' EOS 'The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.' EOS said Noah. EOS 'A little fancy work?' EOS 'My friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.' EOS Ain't there any other line open?' EOS 'What's that?' EOS 'The kinchins, my dear,' said Fagin, 'is the young children that's sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away--they've always got it ready in their hands,--then knock 'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself. EOS ha!' EOS roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy. EOS 'Lord, that's the very thing!' EOS 'To be sure it is,' replied Fagin; 'and you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they're always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. EOS said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and Charlotte had returned. EOS There ain't such a thing in nature.' EOS 'There oughn't to be, if there is,' replied Mr. Bolter. EOS 'The gallows,' continued Fagin, 'the gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow's career on the broad highway. EOS 'What do yer talk about such things for?' EOS 'No, no,' replied Fagin, 'not so bad as that. EOS Not quite so bad.' EOS They'll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.' EOS demanded Mr. Bolter. EOS 'It's all up, Fagin,' said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other. EOS 'Then what do you talk of?' EOS replied Fagin angrily; 'what are you blubbering for?' EOS cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; 'see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. EOS I say, how the Artful would bother 'em wouldn't he?' EOS 'I think I see him now,' cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil. EOS What a game! EOS In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend's eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities. EOS 'Let me think.' EOS One is enough to lose at a time.' EOS 'Really nothing, my dear,' said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, 'really nothing.' EOS inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah's lank form with much disgust. EOS He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip. EOS There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. EOS The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. EOS He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit. EOS 'Hold your tongue, will you?' EOS rejoined the Dodger. EOS 'Where are my priwileges?' EOS 'I wouldn't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,' replied the Dodger. EOS At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest. EOS The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. EOS Eleven. EOS replied Fagin. EOS 'I don't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,' said Sikes, casting off the Jew's hand. EOS Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room. EOS cried Sikes. EOS Where's the gal going to at this time of night?' EOS 'Not far.' EOS 'What answer's that?' EOS 'I want it in the street.' EOS 'Know what I'm--Oh!' EOS 'Let me go, will you,--this minute--this instant.' EOS 'No!' EOS Do you hear me?' EOS 'Hear you!' EOS 'Aye! EOS Wot has come over you, you jade! EOS Wot is it?' EOS 'Cut my limbs off one by one!' EOS screamed the girl. EOS 'Whew!' EOS Wot does it mean?' EOS exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion. EOS 'Light him down,' said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. EOS 'It's a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. EOS Show him a light.' EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS 'Good-night.' EOS Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden. EOS There would be the dangerous villain:  the man I hate:  gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.' EOS There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning. EOS What new power can I acquire?' EOS The means are ready, and shall be set to work. EOS 'Bolter,' said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter. EOS 'What's the matter? EOS Yer never get time enough over yer meals.' EOS 'Out,' said Fagin. EOS 'You did well yesterday, my dear,' said Fagin. EOS The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.' EOS Eh? EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS Not to--'  'Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.' EOS 'And that's what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn't valuable consideration to be gained.' EOS 'Who is she?' EOS It was Sunday. EOS he asked, scarcely above his breath. EOS Fagin nodded yes. EOS 'Plainly?' EOS When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. EOS The tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight. EOS Midnight had come upon the crowded city. EOS The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child:  midnight was upon them all. EOS They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them. EOS 'Not here,' said Nancy hurriedly, 'I am afraid to speak to you here. EOS To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment's survey of the place, he began to descend. EOS So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation. EOS 'To humour me!' EOS 'Why, for what,' said the gentleman in a kinder tone, 'for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? EOS 'I told you before,' replied Nancy, 'that I was afraid to speak to you there. EOS 'I wish I did. EOS He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies. EOS 'I couldn't come,' replied Nancy; 'I was kept by force.' EOS 'Now listen to me.' EOS 'I repeat that I firmly believe it. EOS 'Fagin,' cried the girl, recoiling. EOS 'I will not do it! EOS 'Devil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.' EOS 'Then,' pursued the gentleman, 'this Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent. EOS In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.' EOS 'I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,' said the girl after another interval of silence, 'but I will take your words.' EOS From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated. EOS 'How's this?' EOS 'You know him!' EOS We shall see. EOS 'Nothing,' replied Nancy. EOS 'You will not persist in saying that,' rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart. EOS I am past all hope, indeed.' EOS 'The past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. EOS Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. EOS Come! EOS 'Home!' EOS 'Home, lady,' rejoined the girl. EOS We may have detained her longer than she expected already.' EOS 'Do not speak thus, pray,' returned the young lady, sobbing. EOS The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge. EOS 'Hark!' EOS 'No, my love,' replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. EOS 'She has not moved, and will not till we are gone.' EOS His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog's or rat's. EOS The bell rang gently as he spoke. EOS 'There!' EOS It's been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.' EOS said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. EOS 'That's lucky--for one of us. EOS 'Aye?' EOS he said, resuming his former position. EOS Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we've all been in, more or less--of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,--but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them. EOS 'I don't know,' replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion. EOS 'Wot d'ye mean?' EOS When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him. EOS 'Tell yer what?' EOS 'That about-- _Nancy_,' said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. EOS 'To London Bridge?' EOS 'Where she met two people.' EOS 'So she did.' EOS She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur--she did--did she not?' EOS 'About last Sunday!' EOS replied Noah, considering. EOS 'Again. EOS Tell him that.' EOS 'Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,' replied Noah. EOS ha! EOS cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. EOS Only a word.' EOS They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken. EOS Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.' EOS Without one pause, or moment's consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution:  his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door. EOS He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed. EOS said the man. EOS 'Get up.' EOS 'There's enough light for wot I've got to do.' EOS 'You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.' EOS Bill, Bill, for dear God's sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! EOS It was a ghastly figure to look upon. EOS CHAPTER XLVIII  THE FLIGHT OF SIKES  Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. EOS He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. EOS He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. EOS The very feet of the dog were bloody. EOS It was nine o'clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot. EOS Good to eat, Harry?' EOS Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go. EOS He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky. EOS Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. EOS The figure was behind him. EOS It was like new life to him. EOS Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained. EOS This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime. EOS 'He has gone to Birmingham, they say,' said one:  'but they'll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there'll be a cry all through the country.' EOS They'll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent. EOS If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. EOS Come here!' EOS The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back. EOS At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. EOS But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. EOS 'I have not the inclination to parley,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.' EOS Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down. EOS 'This is all mighty fine,' said Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand. EOS 'I have no brother,' replied Monks. EOS 'Attend to what I do know, and you may not,' said Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Well, they were separated,' said Monks, 'and what of that?' EOS 'Not I.' EOS 'Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,' returned Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'I have nothing to disclose,' rejoined Monks. EOS They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.' EOS 'What's this to me?' EOS He had his sister's soul and person. EOS As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him. EOS The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:  'The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.' EOS 'He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture--a portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor girl--which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey. EOS Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both--even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. EOS Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph. EOS 'Denial to me is vain,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where. EOS I wearied them with new applications. EOS Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words--justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man's Brother! EOS 'I _did not_,' replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; 'but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all. EOS cried the gentleman, 'every word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me. EOS 'Yes, I will.' EOS 'The man will be taken,' he cried. EOS asked Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Yes, yes,' replied the other. EOS A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.' EOS 'Fagin,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'what of him?' EOS asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of Monks. EOS Coupling the poor girl's intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend's inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day. EOS But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature. EOS Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it--as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch. EOS In an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described--there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. EOS 'Well, I thought you'd have been a little more glad to see me than this,' replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air. EOS There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger, turned to Chitling and said,  'When was Fagin took then?' EOS 'Just at dinner-time--two o'clock this afternoon. EOS 'Poor Bet! EOS 'This is a smash,' observed Toby, biting his lips. EOS I can see 'em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst 'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they'd tear his heart out!' EOS While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes's dog bounded into the room. EOS 'Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he must have come a long way.' EOS exclaimed Toby. EOS 'He's been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he's been many a time and often. EOS But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!' EOS He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn't be so easy.' EOS This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody. EOS No, it wasn't he. EOS 'Don't leave us in the dark,' said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished. EOS If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted. EOS They seemed never to have heard its tones before. EOS Is it true, or a lie?' EOS 'Damn you all!' EOS Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him. EOS There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. EOS 'Charley!' EOS 'You monster!' EOS The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes's eyes sunk gradually to the ground. EOS If there's the pluck of a man among you three, you'll help me. EOS Murder! EOS screamed the boy. EOS Run straight to the room where the light is. EOS 'And the windows too?' EOS I'll cheat you yet!' EOS Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.' EOS The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud. EOS Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him. EOS The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top. EOS The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose. EOS The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased. EOS Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet. EOS He fell for five-and-thirty feet. EOS But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot:  a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head. EOS But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. EOS Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down. EOS Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. EOS All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. EOS They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices. EOS 'Yes,' said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy:  the beating of whose heart he might have heard. EOS 'That is the bastard child.' EOS returned Monks. EOS He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery--to be explained one day--prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back. EOS He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his. EOS He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her--prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before--and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted. EOS Monks was silent. EOS He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. EOS If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. EOS The girl's father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate--I love her for it now--could add. EOS The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.' EOS She was right. EOS 'The locket and ring?' EOS 'You know what became of them.' EOS he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.' EOS 'I never saw him in all my life,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?' EOS 'No, no,' said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws. EOS 'No, no, no.' EOS 'And we know more than that,' resumed the first, 'for she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.' EOS 'Young lady,' said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, 'give me your hand. EOS Do you know this young lady, sir?' EOS 'The child,' replied Monks, 'when her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced--the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.' EOS The people were poor and began to sicken--at least the man did--of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send. EOS I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world. EOS See here--look, look, my dear!' EOS Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears:  for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain. EOS They were a long, long time alone. EOS Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie. EOS 'Dear Rose, I know it all.' EOS You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.' EOS What have I heard!' EOS she faltered. EOS Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation. EOS 'Oliver, my child,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'where have you been, and why do you look so sad? EOS What is the matter?' EOS At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf. EOS As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face:  some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes:  and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. EOS He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. EOS He looked up into the gallery again. EOS He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another. EOS The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder. EOS He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man--an old man--and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again. EOS They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. EOS Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there--alone. EOS To be hanged by the neck till he was dead. EOS As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. EOS The cell had been built for many years. EOS Scores of men must have passed their last hours there. EOS Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. EOS There was no day; it was gone as soon as come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. EOS He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together. EOS His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up. EOS Eleven! EOS These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene. EOS Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. EOS They did so. EOS 'Good boy, Charley--well done--' he mumbled. EOS 'Do you hear me, some of you? EOS He has been the--the--somehow the cause of all this. EOS 'Strike them all dead! EOS 'Oliver,' cried Fagin, beckoning to him. EOS 'I am not afraid,' said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow's hand. EOS I want to talk to you, my dear. EOS Let me say one prayer. EOS 'That's right, that's right,' said Fagin. EOS Now, now, now!' EOS 'Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?' EOS 'If I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position--'  'Nothing will do that, sir,' replied the man, shaking his head. EOS He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard. EOS Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver's warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world. EOS Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife. EOS As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. EOS They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong. EOS I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. EOS It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. EOS Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood. EOS It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. EOS All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. EOS There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. EOS All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. EOS As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain's” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. EOS “So, then! EOS “What o'clock do you make it, Joe?”  “Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”  “My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter's yet! EOS Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. EOS The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. EOS “Who wants me? EOS “Come on at a footpace! EOS The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, “Sir.”  “There is nothing to apprehend. EOS Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE.”  Jerry started in his saddle. EOS Good night.”  With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. EOS With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action. EOS “Hallo, Joe.”  “Did you hear the message?”  “I did, Joe.”  “What did you make of it, Tom?”  “Nothing at all, Joe.”  “That's a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it myself.”  Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. EOS The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. EOS Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. EOS But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white. EOS A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre:  “Buried how long?”  The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”  “You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”  “Long ago.”  “You know that you are recalled to life?”  “They tell me so.”  “I hope you care to live?”  “I can't say.”  “Shall I show her to you? EOS The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek. EOS Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again. EOS “Buried how long?”  “Almost eighteen years.”  “You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”  “Long ago.”  The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone. EOS There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees. EOS “There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”  “Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. EOS The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. EOS Bed, sir?”  “I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”  “And then breakfast, sir? EOS Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast. EOS His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. EOS Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. EOS The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:  “I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day. EOS Before our people's time here, sir. EOS The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”  “I believe so.”  “But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?”  “You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth.”  “Indeed, sir!”  Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. EOS According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages. EOS A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. EOS “So soon?”  Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience. EOS As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high. EOS He made her another bow. EOS I thank you very gratefully. EOS I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.”  “Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing shadow. EOS In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. EOS He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”  “Not of Beauvais?”  “Why, yes, of Beauvais. EOS Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of Beauvais. EOS And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since. EOS How you start!”  She did, indeed, start. EOS “A matter of business. EOS A-a-matter of business--don't be distressed. EOS Miss, if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don't kneel! EOS You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused? EOS If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. EOS You have business before you; useful business. EOS Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”  A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. EOS The best and the worst are known to you, now. EOS Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all events--out of France. EOS It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. EOS The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again. EOS It was prevalent everywhere. EOS Let them bring another.”  There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way:  “Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”  The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. EOS Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. EOS Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. EOS As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”  “What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge to himself; “I don't know you.”  But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter. EOS Is it not so, Jacques?”  “It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned. EOS The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of my establishment. EOS Gentlemen, adieu!”  They paid for their wine, and left the place. EOS The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word. EOS Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher. EOS Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. EOS Business! EOS There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:  “Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”  “I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”  “Is that well?”  “_I_ think it is well.”  “Who are the few? EOS The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something. EOS Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side. EOS He stopped there, and faced round. EOS Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. EOS VI. EOS So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his work. EOS He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak. EOS “You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge. EOS I never saw the mode. EOS “And the maker's name?” said Defarge. EOS “Did you ask me for my name?”  “Assuredly I did.”  “One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”  “Is that all?”  “One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”  With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken. EOS No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. EOS And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her. EOS He had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. EOS The two spectators started forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. EOS In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking. EOS But not for long. EOS He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger. EOS How can it be! EOS But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently, though slowly. EOS “No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. EOS All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me. EOS Kiss me, kiss me! EOS Weep for her, then, and for me! EOS She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light. EOS “If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he could be taken away--”  “But, consider. EOS “More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France. EOS Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”  “That's business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”  “Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. EOS If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him. EOS No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face. EOS They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. EOS He readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand in both his own. EOS Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing. EOS Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. EOS “Your papers, travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head. EOS It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. EOS This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. EOS In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable. EOS Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. EOS Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee. EOS You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child.”  Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board. EOS --Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin. EOS Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. EOS At it again?”  His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”  “Don't do it!” said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions. EOS “Al-ways rusty! EOS He don't get no iron rust here!”     II. EOS Much better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”  “Very well. EOS Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. EOS The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's attention, and show him where you stand. EOS Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you.”  “Is that all, sir?”  “That's all. EOS It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him. EOS Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open. EOS After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court. EOS “Oh! EOS Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar. EOS All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. EOS His condition was that of a young gentleman. EOS As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. EOS The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever. EOS Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him. EOS The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing. EOS III. EOS That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. EOS That, he had been the prisoner's friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. EOS That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. EOS That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General's) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr. Attorney-General's) father and mother. EOS His property. EOS What was it? EOS Yes, he had. EOS Yes. EOS How many times? EOS Of what profession? EOS Ever kicked downstairs? EOS Ever live by cheating at play? EOS Never. EOS Not more than other gentlemen do. EOS No. EOS Expect to get anything by this evidence? EOS Or to do anything? EOS He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. EOS He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given information. EOS He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. EOS Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?”  “I am.”  “On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?”  “It did.”  “Were there any other passengers in the mail?”  “Two.”  “Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”  “They did.”  “Mr. EOS Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. EOS They are here.”  “They are here. EOS His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart. EOS The buzz of the great flies was loud again. EOS That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”  “Let me interrupt you for a moment. EOS “Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition. EOS He said that this business had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come.”  “Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? EOS Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington. EOS She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar. EOS A singular circumstance then arose in the case. EOS “Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the prisoner. EOS Are they very like each other?”  Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into comparison. EOS Don't you see she will fall!”  There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father. EOS “Mr. EOS Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”  “Yes, I could. EOS Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there. EOS “Here, sir! EOS It's a fight to get back again. EOS Here I am, sir!”  Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. EOS Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. EOS Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. EOS “I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe.”  It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again. EOS “You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. EOS Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”  “Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night's work to do yet. EOS A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. EOS Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”  Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it. EOS “If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”  Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before, sir. EOS If you'll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your business.”  “Business! EOS Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton. EOS I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!”  Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. EOS You speak faintly.”  “I begin to think I _am_ faint.”  “Then why the devil don't you dine? EOS “As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it. EOS Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I.”  Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all. EOS How does it feel? EOS “She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. EOS He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. EOS Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?”  “I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”  “Think? EOS You hate the fellow.”  He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him. EOS A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted. EOS “Ten o'clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake him--“ten o'clock, sir.”  “_What's_ the matter?”  “Ten o'clock, sir.”  “What do you mean? EOS I remember. EOS “You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver. EOS When did it strike you?”  “I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”  Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch. EOS Get to work, get to work.”  Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two. EOS “How much?”  “Only two sets of them.”  “Give me the worst first.”  “There they are, Sydney. EOS The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both. EOS But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do. EOS You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”  “I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”  “I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said Carton. EOS At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed. EOS “Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”  pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine. EOS It's a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking. EOS Turn me in some other direction before I go.”  “Well then! EOS Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up his glass. EOS She was a golden-haired doll!”  “Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”  “Quick to see what happened! EOS And now I'll have no more drink; I'll get to bed.”  When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows. EOS Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away. EOS These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night. EOS “As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I'll go upstairs.”  Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics. EOS “I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began. EOS “_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”  “Hundreds,” said Miss Pross. EOS It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it. EOS “Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of. EOS “It wasn't ending it, I suppose? EOS “Do you imagine--” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up short with:  “Never imagine anything. EOS Surely not. EOS Believe me, Miss Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest.”  “Well! EOS “True,” said he, “and fearful to reflect upon. EOS Sometimes, he gets up in the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his room. EOS The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible. EOS In the arrangements of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously. EOS From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased. EOS It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air. EOS The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. EOS They told me a curious thing when I was there.”  “What was that?” Lucie asked. EOS “In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. EOS “No, my dear, not ill. EOS But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House. EOS The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and that the rain had startled him. EOS Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. EOS “Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious!”  It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it. EOS “What a night it has been! EOS Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate. EOS Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family. EOS As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day. EOS Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score. EOS Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty. EOS If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct. EOS The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away. EOS And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out! EOS Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth. EOS “I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way, and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”  With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs. EOS There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. EOS The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”  He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. EOS They were as silent, however, as the men. EOS “How do they call you?”  “They call me Defarge.”  “Of what trade?”  “Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”  “Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. EOS “You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. EOS Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. EOS But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison. EOS Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed. EOS I had the honour of being passed on the road.”  “Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”  “Monseigneur, it is true.”  “What did you look at, so fixedly?”  “Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”  He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage. EOS All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage. EOS Who was he?”  “Your clemency, Monseigneur! EOS Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle. EOS Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night. EOS The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance. EOS What is it? EOS He is quiet. EOS Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch. EOS “Monseigneur, hear me! EOS Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. EOS A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers. EOS “My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they said he was not arrived.”  Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur. EOS His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips, when he put it down. EOS “Good,” said the imperturbable master. EOS He was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels. EOS But it is useless to discuss the question. EOS I am, as you say, at a disadvantage. EOS They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few! EOS It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the worse. EOS Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. EOS From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? EOS If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. EOS “Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways. EOS Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”  “Death has done that!” said the Marquis. EOS “Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. EOS France may be, but is the property? EOS It is little to relinquish. EOS “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?”  “I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day--work.”  “In England, for example?”  “Yes. EOS The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”  The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted. EOS The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet. EOS For the rest, it is my Refuge.”  “They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. EOS “A Doctor with a daughter. EOS “I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. EOS That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”  “I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”  So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep. EOS In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep. EOS Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain. EOS What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora? EOS Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. EOS He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. EOS I do you justice; I believe it.”  His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. EOS But I love her. EOS I believe it.”  “But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say. EOS Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness. EOS Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”  His touch still lingered on her father's hand. EOS I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”  “Do you seek any guidance from me?”  “I ask none, sir. EOS For which reason, Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that word, to save my life.”  “I am sure of it. EOS Tell me what it is.”  “It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. EOS “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog.”  “And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such a sensitive and poetical spirit--”  “Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don't prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.”  “You are a luckier, if you mean that.”  “I don't mean that. EOS “No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, “I'll have this out with you. EOS Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there! EOS As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”  He asked the question with some appearance of scorn. EOS “I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton. EOS And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. EOS You don't know the value of money, you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse.”  The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive. EOS “Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the face. EOS Find out somebody. EOS After some mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary. EOS As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly saw his way to the verdict. EOS He called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider. EOS After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer case could be. EOS “Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver. EOS There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. EOS He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.  “Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character. EOS But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, “you know there really is so much too much of you!”  “Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!”  Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen. EOS “D--n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”  “Oh dear yes! EOS “And advancing?”  “If you come to advancing you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”  “Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. EOS He broke the awkward silence by saying:  “This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. EOS “Granted. EOS Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. EOS If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. EOS Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow, he got it down. EOS “Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. EOS Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. EOS Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed. EOS Now, pray say no more about it. EOS I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account. EOS From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctor's door. EOS I shall never be better than I am. EOS I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you. EOS I am like one who died young. EOS I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be.”  “Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? EOS Can I not recall you--forgive me again!--to a better course? EOS If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done. EOS I distress you; I draw fast to an end. EOS May it otherwise be light and happy!”  He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her. EOS The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”  “I will, Mr. Carton.”  “My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and between whom and you there is an impassable space. EOS The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. EOS XIV. EOS Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men. EOS What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip? EOS Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. EOS What's it about?”  “_I_ don't know,” said the man. EOS Yah! EOS “I've seen him. EOS The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. EOS He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot. EOS “Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on entering. EOS You may say yes, Jerry.”  Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction. EOS With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. EOS If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. EOS Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you don't. EOS Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. EOS The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together. EOS The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. EOS Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. EOS He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. EOS Then, they moved away on their hands and knees. EOS They fished with a spade, at first. EOS Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more. EOS He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to shun. EOS “You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me and my partners suffer. EOS You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?”  “I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears. EOS If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! EOS “His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a branch of Scientific goods.”  “Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?” asked the lively boy. EOS Knitting   There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. EOS No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. EOS This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. EOS It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. EOS It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. EOS A third man got up and went out. EOS Speak, Jacques Five!”  The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”  “Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, “at the commencement.”  “I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. EOS Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! EOS “The tall man is lost, and he is sought--how many months? EOS “I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. EOS Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! EOS “As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. EOS They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”  He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. EOS Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”  “All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish. EOS “Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge. EOS The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid. EOS It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand.”  “And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. EOS “Long live the Devil! EOS Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?”  “Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. EOS He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday.”  “What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. EOS Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. EOS Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very new and agreeable. EOS A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. EOS The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced. EOS “It is necessary to register him. EOS “Good. EOS “There are only the usual odours.”  “I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged. EOS “Oh, the men, the men!”  “But my dear!” began Defarge. EOS Eh well! EOS I tell thee it is always advancing. EOS Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour. EOS Bah! EOS But it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife, it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”  “Eh well! EOS A rose lay beside her, and if she now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air. EOS There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. EOS Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. EOS Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. EOS They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable. EOS “_John_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. EOS “A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. EOS the poor Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion. EOS “I know nothing of it.”  Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction. EOS I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.”  “Hah!” muttered Defarge. EOS “You don't hear much about them now?” said the spy. EOS But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. EOS But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. EOS Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty, Freedom and Life. EOS Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves. EOS “You are happy, my dear father?”  “Quite, my child.”  They had said little, though they had been there a long time. EOS She had employed herself in both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so. EOS In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and its going. EOS _I_ know it well, but do you know it? EOS More than that,” he added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.”  “If I could hope _that_, my father!--”  “Believe it, love! EOS Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. EOS Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?”  “If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.”  He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied:  “My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. EOS “See!” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon. EOS Whether it had been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. EOS (There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) EOS I have seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door. EOS The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child. EOS Hardly, I think? EOS The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more. EOS Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. EOS She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then, leaned over him, and looked at him. EOS She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved. EOS Lord bless me! EOS You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. EOS The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. EOS But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind. EOS He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. EOS “What's that?”  Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. EOS Let it be.”  “But, Doctor Manette. EOS Think again. EOS The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. EOS In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind. EOS These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. EOS In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. EOS But, Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it. EOS Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. EOS The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day. EOS For, going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window. EOS If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain. EOS So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday. EOS I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”  “That is the fact.”  “Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit originally?”  “Once.”  “And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all respects--as he was then?”  “I think in all respects.”  “You spoke of his daughter. EOS Does his daughter know of the relapse?”  “No. EOS That was very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while. EOS There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. EOS “I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, “that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.”  “Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask. EOS He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”  “Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry, with natural hesitation. EOS As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I should have great hope. EOS I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “To the first, then. EOS He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. EOS It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation. EOS I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of association would renew it. EOS I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. EOS It was not for his friend to abate that confidence. EOS He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach. EOS “I would recommend him to sacrifice it. EOS For his daughter's sake, my dear Manette!”  Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him! EOS They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. EOS Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”  “We are already friends, I hope.”  “You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't mean any fashion of speech. EOS “Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. EOS The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I always remember them. EOS Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.”  “Ah!” said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that away. EOS “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. EOS I wish you would forget it.”  “I forgot it long ago.”  “Fashion of speech again! EOS I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. EOS Good Heaven, what was there to dismiss! EOS At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done any good, and never will.”  “I don't know that you 'never will. EOS Well! EOS I may use that freedom with your name?”  “I think so, Carton, by this time.”  They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. EOS Within a minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever. EOS But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.”  She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours. EOS I will remember it as long as I live.”  He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms. EOS If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time--  “God bless her for her sweet compassion!”     XXI. EOS Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided her breast. EOS Suffer them and forbid them not. EOS But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion. EOS How near to her heart the echoes of her child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told. EOS We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. EOS Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? EOS I can't see.”  “Of course, it has been kept for you.”  “Thank ye, my dear. EOS “They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? EOS Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat. EOS Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it. EOS Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife. EOS One drawbridge down! EOS Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!” Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot. EOS Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. EOS “Quick!”  “I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me. EOS Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone. EOS A crowbar? EOS “Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. EOS And see! EOS Hold the light higher, you!”  With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. EOS In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a cautious touch. EOS Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once more. EOS Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people. EOS Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment. EOS In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman's. EOS “See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out. EOS Impassive faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “THOU DIDST IT!”  Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. EOS XXII. EOS One of her sisterhood knitted beside her. EOS “Listen, then! EOS “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again. EOS “Say then, my husband. EOS Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another. EOS Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! EOS This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. EOS Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children. EOS That was well done. EOS The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him! EOS It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. EOS Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him out! EOS Bring him to the lamp!”  Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. EOS Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of. EOS Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets. EOS Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip. EOS It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door:  “At last it is come, my dear!”  “Eh well!” returned madame. EOS “Almost.”  Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. EOS The drum's was the only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. EOS Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! EOS The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur. EOS “Where?”  “Here.”  He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village. EOS Will you wake me?”  “Surely.”  The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. EOS “Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. EOS A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. EOS Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again. EOS There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door. EOS The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! EOS The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast. EOS The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. EOS Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. EOS But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. EOS As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. EOS To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as a matter of course. EOS On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. EOS “Indeed! EOS Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!”  “However, I am not going,” said Charles Darnay, with a smile. EOS The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! EOS Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. EOS The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? EOS “June 21, 1792. EOS “The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant. EOS Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now. EOS With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons. EOS The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. EOS Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.”  “What is his name?” said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand. EOS '”  “Any time mentioned?”  “He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”  “Any person mentioned?”  “No.”  He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. EOS The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone. EOS He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris. EOS Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning. EOS His life is forfeit to the people. EOS The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done. EOS Happily, however, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads. EOS “Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”  The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. EOS When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed the guard to open the barrier. EOS He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the city. EOS You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La Force.”  “Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. EOS “Under what law, and for what offence?”  The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment. EOS I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. EOS The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them. EOS The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree. EOS In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family. EOS The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him. EOS That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now. EOS The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. EOS “Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me, emigrant.”  Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes. EOS So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead. EOS Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades! EOS The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. EOS “Yours,” said the gaoler. EOS “He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. EOS There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! EOS A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question. EOS Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to night. EOS Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation. EOS What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. EOS He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame. EOS Lucie and her father! EOS Manette! EOS What is it?”  With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! EOS My husband!”  “Your husband, Lucie?”  “Charles.”  “What of Charles?”  “Here. EOS “Here, in Paris?”  “Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts. EOS An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”  The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. EOS I have been a Bastille prisoner. EOS There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? EOS My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. EOS Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say. EOS I know you are true.”  The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard. EOS Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. EOS But, such awful workers, and such awful work! EOS They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend's ashy face. EOS It may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!”  Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind. EOS His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. EOS Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force! EOS Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! EOS Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. EOS Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered. EOS “The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”  Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. EOS But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away. EOS It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. EOS “Do you know me?”  He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five to fifty years of age. EOS “Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as they moved. EOS It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted. EOS You will help me to see him if you can?”  “Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. EOS For my child's sake! EOS “What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile. EOS “Influence; he says something touching influence?”  “That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has much influence around him.”  “Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. EOS Calm in Storm   Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. EOS To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. EOS But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all known him in his present character. EOS For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him. EOS Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose. EOS “All curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands.”  But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. EOS Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart. EOS During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband's head next day. EOS As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there. EOS He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.”  They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening:  “My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. EOS When he can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. EOS The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. EOS But it's not my business. EOS Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! EOS All the family!”  Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight. EOS It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. EOS She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. EOS His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone. EOS Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. EOS Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. EOS This was the Carmagnole. EOS “O my father!” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”  “I know, my dear, I know. EOS Not one of them would harm you.”  “I am not frightened for myself, my father. EOS You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”  “I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!”  “You cannot see him, my poor dear?”  “No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, “no.”  A footstep in the snow. EOS Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake. EOS I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal. EOS He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the Conciergerie; I have timely information. EOS There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. EOS It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank. EOS Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property. EOS Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold. EOS There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over. EOS The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. EOS “Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned. EOS Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men. EOS Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. EOS There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded. EOS the President desired to know. EOS Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. EOS At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. EOS The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, “Long live the Republic!”  The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. EOS And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her. EOS All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. EOS Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”  “It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”  retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un's.”  “Who's he?” said Miss Pross. EOS Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “Old Nick's.”  “Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. EOS They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder, and Mischief.”  “Hush, dear! EOS “Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets. EOS Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! EOS “Hush, dear! EOS “Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”  Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church. EOS “I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross, approvingly. EOS Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House. EOS Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. EOS “My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand on hers, “command yourself. EOS “Oh father, father. EOS “The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,” said the first. EOS We seek him. EOS I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day. EOS This citizen,” pointing out the second who had entered, “is from Saint Antoine.”  The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:  “He is accused by Saint Antoine.”  “Of what?” asked the Doctor. EOS “Citizen Doctor,” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no more. EOS “Will you tell me who denounced him?”  “It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here.”  The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. EOS It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the Republic. EOS Better for him that his beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close. EOS For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder. EOS Who's this man?”  Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. EOS “If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. EOS I know you. EOS He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself. EOS The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--  “I'll tell you,” said Sydney. EOS But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction. EOS Are we ready? EOS “Pray sit down.”  As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence. EOS “Mr. EOS Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently attentive. EOS “I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. EOS Don't hurry.”  He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. EOS Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. EOS I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?”  “I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.”  “I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister--”  “I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton. EOS While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of contemplating cards:  “And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated. EOS That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he?”  “French. EOS Yet I know the face.”  “I think not. EOS I am sure not. EOS Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”  “Provincial,” said the spy. EOS “No. EOS “Cly! EOS “That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. EOS “So _you_ put him in his coffin?”  “I did.”  “Who took him out of it?”  Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you mean?”  “I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn't never in it. EOS It was a take in. EOS I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”  Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself. EOS What I stand to, is, that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. EOS A strong card--a certain Guillotine card! EOS “I throw up. EOS You told me you had a proposal; what is it? EOS Now, what do you want with me?”  “Not very much. EOS It being all spent, he said, rising:  “So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. EOS That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character. EOS And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. EOS equally like smoke, if not more so. EOS He'd never have no good of it; he'd want all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in--even if it wos so.”  “Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am shocked at the sight of you.”  “Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr. Cruncher, “even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--”  “Don't prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS If it wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of 'em in with a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe. EOS He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it. EOS “To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. EOS “Don't tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. EOS It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it. EOS He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. EOS As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. EOS I was ready to go.”  They were both silent. EOS “I am in my seventy-eighth year.”  “You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?”  “I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. EOS “There is nobody to weep for me.”  “How can you say that? EOS Wouldn't She weep for you? EOS ), and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”  “I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. EOS You know my vagabond and restless habits. EOS A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. EOS “She came out here,” he said, looking about him, “turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. EOS A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door. EOS You have seen him at work?”  “Never.”  “Go and see him when he has a good batch. EOS A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man. EOS hi! EOS hi!”  Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:  “For you, citizen?”  “For me.”  “You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? EOS He put them, one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberately left the shop. EOS His mother had died, years before. EOS With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets. EOS But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. EOS Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them always. EOS There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds. EOS Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. EOS A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there. EOS Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention. EOS Reaccused and retaken yesterday. EOS The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly? EOS “President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud. EOS Listen to what is to follow. EOS “Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen.”  “I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; “I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. EOS I knew it from himself. EOS This is that written paper. EOS I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.”  “Let it be read.”  In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows. EOS “One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast. EOS As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop. EOS As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too. EOS “'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.' EOS They both entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. EOS I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. EOS It was not opened immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face. EOS But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers. EOS “From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. EOS On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.  “I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger of suffocation. EOS Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' EOS “'I do not address her brother?' EOS As it is, time must be lost. EOS “'Do you doubt them?' EOS They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' EOS “On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most. EOS He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. EOS The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay. EOS said I. EOS “The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me. EOS She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his. EOS “'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. EOS “'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion, for a little while. EOS Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? EOS “'She heard me, and ran in. EOS I told her not to come near us till he was dead. EOS Where is the man who was here? EOS In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. EOS I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.' EOS Hush!' EOS I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead. EOS The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.' EOS “'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?' EOS “'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.' EOS Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me. EOS She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. EOS “My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. EOS I took it from his hand, but laid it on the table. EOS 'Under the circumstances, no.' EOS I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand. EOS I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances. EOS I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. EOS It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful. EOS I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched. EOS She did not know that the girl was dead. EOS Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many. EOS But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock. EOS The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the Tribunal adjourned. EOS O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!”  There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad. EOS “I can bear it, dear Charles. EOS I say farewell to her by you.”  “My husband. EOS What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us! EOS We know, now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. EOS Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. EOS As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet. EOS Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. EOS Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. EOS “Shall I take her to a coach? EOS Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver. EOS There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her. EOS “Try them again. EOS I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such great things as this. EOS Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort. EOS It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.”  “I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. EOS Let us stretch the hour or two. EOS It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again. EOS There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice. EOS I drink to the Republic.”  Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”  Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.”  The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith! EOS “It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. EOS “Why stop? EOS There is great force in that. EOS Ask my husband, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked. EOS Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. EOS “Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”  Customers entered, and the group was broken up. EOS Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known. EOS Carton was the first to speak:  “The last chance is gone: it was not much. EOS As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. EOS “A moment! EOS “Keep it for me until to-morrow. EOS He confirms me. EOS But how?”  “I am going to tell you how. EOS This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. EOS You follow me?”  “So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the Doctor's chair, “even of this distress.”  “You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. EOS Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father. EOS Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband's cheerfully.” He faltered for an instant; then went on as before. EOS Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. EOS You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?”  “I am sure of it.”  “I thought so. EOS Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. EOS The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”  “I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”  “You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place. EOS Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then for England!”  “Why, then,” said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side.”  “By the help of Heaven you shall! EOS Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. EOS He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. EOS He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. EOS But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms. EOS The worst of the strife was over. EOS Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. EOS Go you in alone; I wait near. EOS Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot. EOS “Draw on these boots of mine. EOS Put your hands to them; put your will to them. EOS You will only die with me. EOS It is madness.”  “It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? EOS It is madness. EOS Quick, friend, quick!”  Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. EOS “'If you remember,'” said Carton, dictating, “'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. EOS That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. EOS “Vapour?”  “Something that crossed me?”  “I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. EOS “Hurry, hurry!”  The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. EOS If it had been otherwise;'” the hand was at the prisoner's face; “'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. EOS The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist. EOS The parting interview has overpowered me. EOS Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often. EOS Your life is in your own hands. EOS Call assistance!”  “You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a last moment. EOS The Spy returned immediately, with two men. EOS “Lift him, and come away!”  The door closed, and Carton was left alone. EOS It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. EOS It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on. EOS “I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. EOS Papers!”  The papers are handed out, and read.

EOS It is represented that he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic. EOS It is not a great deal, that! EOS They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine. EOS There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller. EOS So far, we are not pursued.”  Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees. EOS “Ho! EOS How many to the Guillotine to-day?”  “Fifty-two.”  “I said so! EOS A brave number! EOS Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued. EOS “But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good Republican? EOS My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. EOS “I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure. EOS I must act for myself, therefore. EOS “Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. EOS I know what I know. EOS “Transparently!”  “There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile. EOS Can I spare him?”  “He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. EOS “We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”  “He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. EOS You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.--You?”  The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. EOS The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw. EOS Keep me my usual chair. EOS “You will not be late?”  “I shall be there before the commencement.”  “And before the tumbrils arrive. EOS Be sure you are there, my soul,” said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”  Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. EOS She was absolutely without pity. EOS To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. EOS Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. EOS Likewise wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong.”  “I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan. EOS I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”  “Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! EOS Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!” This was Mr. Cruncher's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one. EOS And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer. EOS Now, pray let us think! EOS “Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house straight, and make that change.”  “I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, “about leaving of you, you see. EOS Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. EOS I feel certain of it. EOS Her first act was to shut them. EOS “You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss Pross, in her breathing. EOS “It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,” said Madame Defarge. EOS “I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. EOS I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. EOS “We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling,” said Miss Pross. EOS It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. EOS Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. EOS These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. EOS “Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him. EOS “Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again, presently. EOS Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head. EOS The Footsteps Die Out For Ever   Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. EOS As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. EOS It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. EOS “Which is Evremonde?” says a man behind him. EOS “That. EOS To the Guillotine all aristocrats! EOS The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine. EOS “Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, “and here are the tumbrils! EOS I cry with vexation and disappointment!”  As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads. EOS The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. EOS Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom. EOS I am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.”  “Tell me what it is.”  “I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly. EOS Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I tell her! EOS Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. EOS Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. EOS Elenchi, 33. EOS 25 C), intended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. EOS We can only guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathising with the struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. EOS Introd. EOS The extent to which Aristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the Politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the more necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. EOS Even the fragments of his words when 'repeated at second-hand' (Symp. EOS 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature. EOS Such a State is hardly to be realized in this world and quickly degenerates. EOS Lewis in the Classical Museum, vol. EOS To this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded to the question--What is justice, stripped of appearances? EOS The second division (2) includes the remainder of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books, which are mainly occupied with the construction of the first State and the first education. EOS The Republic, like the Phaedrus (see Introduction to Phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the Hellenic temple, which at last fades away into the heavens. EOS There may be some use in such general descriptions, but they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer. EOS To Plato himself, the enquiry 'what was the intention of the writer,' or 'what was the principal argument of the Republic' would have been hardly intelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed (cp. EOS Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or 'the day of the Lord,' or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the 'Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings' only convey, to us at least, their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of good--like the sun in the visible world;--about human perfection, which is justice--about education beginning in youth and continuing in later years--about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind--about 'the world' which is the embodiment of them--about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life. EOS For the practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bear the greatest 'marks of design'--justice more than the external frame-work of the State, the idea of good more than justice. EOS The great science of dialectic or the organisation of ideas has no real content; but is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and all existence. EOS It is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books that Plato reaches the 'summit of speculation,' and these, although they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker, may therefore be regarded as the most important, as they are also the most original, portions of the work. EOS The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. EOS His love of conversation, his affection, his indifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting traits of character. EOS The evening of life is described by Plato in the most expressive manner, yet with the fewest possible touches. EOS The pompous and empty Sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him. EOS He is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates, but his noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his assailant. EOS When attacked by Glaucon he is humorously protected by Socrates 'as one who has never been his enemy and is now his friend.' EOS From Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle's Rhetoric we learn that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in later ages. EOS He is a soldier, and, like Adeimantus, has been distinguished at the battle of Megara (anno 456? EOS Adeimantus pursues the argument further. EOS It is Adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the Dialogue. EOS For example, throughout the greater part of the sixth book, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. EOS Glaucon resumes his place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending the higher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits in the course of the discussion. EOS The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent. EOS Neither can we be absolutely certain that Socrates himself taught the immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in the Republic (cp. EOS Apol. EOS A real element of Socratic teaching, which is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example and illustration (Greek): 'Let us apply the test of common instances.' EOS And with this representation of him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance, though they cannot be shown to have been speculations of Socrates. EOS The common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or has only partially admitted it. EOS But they are to be pitied or laughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their nostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a Hydra's head. EOS The whole work is supposed to be recited by Socrates on the day after the festival to a small party, consisting of Critias, Timaeus, Hermocrates, and another; this we learn from the first words of the Timaeus. EOS The description of old age is finished, and Plato, as his manner is, has touched the key-note of the whole work in asking for the definition of justice, first suggesting the question which Glaucon afterwards pursues respecting external goods, and preparing for the concluding mythus of the world below in the slight allusion of Cephalus. EOS Did he mean that I was to give back arms to a madman? EOS 398-381)... EOS Thus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to be inadequate to the wants of the age; the authority of the poets is set aside, and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an approach to the Christian precept of forgiveness of injuries. EOS Similar words are applied by the Persian mystic poet to the Divine being when the questioning spirit is stirred within him:--'If because I do evil, Thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?' EOS The 'interrogation' of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of Homer; the conclusion that the maxim, 'Do good to your friends and harm to your enemies,' being erroneous, could not have been the word of any great man, are all of them very characteristic of the Platonic Socrates. EOS At first Thrasymachus is reluctant to argue; but at length, with a promise of payment on the part of the company and of praise from Socrates, he is induced to open the game. EOS Thrasymachus is indignant at the illustration, and in pompous words, apparently intended to restore dignity to the argument, he explains his meaning to be that the rulers make laws for their own interests. EOS And justice has an interest which is the interest not of the ruler or judge, but of those who come under his sway. EOS Why do you ask? EOS 'And what can I do more for you?' EOS And if a State (or Church) were composed entirely of good men, they would be affected by the last motive only; and there would be as much 'nolo episcopari' as there is at present of the opposite... EOS The musician, doctor, skilled artist of any sort, does not seek to gain more than the skilled, but only more than the unskilled (that is to say, he works up to a rule, standard, law, and does not exceed it), whereas the unskilled makes random efforts at excess. EOS Is not absolute injustice absolute weakness also? EOS Thus the sophistical fabric has been demolished, chiefly by appealing to the analogy of the arts. EOS Virtue, like art, must take means to an end; good manners are both an art and a virtue; character is naturally described under the image of a statue; and there are many other figures of speech which are readily transferred from art to morals. EOS And yet in the absurdities which follow from some uses of the analogy, there seems to be an intimation conveyed that virtue is more than art. EOS Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be noted in the words 'men who are injured are made more unjust.' EOS Nothing is concluded; but the tendency of the dialectical process, here as always, is to enlarge our conception of ideas, and to widen their application to human life. EOS No one would observe such a compact if he were not obliged. EOS Let us suppose that the just and unjust have two rings, like that of Gyges in the well-known story, which make them invisible, and then no difference will appear in them, for every one will do evil if he can. EOS I might add (but I would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injustice--they will tell you) that the just man will be scourged, racked, bound, will have his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified (literally impaled)--and all this because he ought to have preferred seeming to being. EOS How different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance as the true reality! EOS "Will he," in the language of Pindar, "make justice his high tower, or fortify himself with crooked deceit?" EOS But what of the world below? EOS Nay, says the argument, there are atoning powers who will set that matter right, as the poets, who are the sons of the gods, tell us; and this is confirmed by the authority of the State. EOS Had we been taught in early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul, and unseen by any human or divine eye, we should not have needed others to be our guardians, but every one would have been the guardian of himself. EOS The obligation of maintaining authority under all circumstances and sometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and has become a sort of instinct among civilized men. EOS And as men become better such theories appear more and more untruthful to them, because they are more conscious of their own disinterestedness. EOS Not that there is (1) any absurdity in the attempt to frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances. EOS He is developing his idea gradually in a series of positions or situations. EOS He seems to feel the difficulty of 'justifying the ways of God to man.' EOS The common life of Greece is not enough for them; they must penetrate deeper into the nature of things. EOS Under the fanciful illustration of the large letters he implies that he will only look for justice in society, and that from the State he will proceed to the individual. EOS Secondly, it may be remarked that Plato preserves the genuine character of Greek thought in beginning with the State and in going on to the individual. EOS And to this type he is constantly tending to revert, whenever the influence of custom, or of party spirit, or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for him. EOS Here follows a rustic picture of their way of life. EOS Who then can be a guardian? EOS But what shall their education be? EOS Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change in God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. EOS By another?--but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. EOS He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image. EOS But some one will say that God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form in relation to us. EOS God then is true, he is absolutely true; he changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by word or sign. EOS We should not interpret a Platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in too literal or matter-of-fact a style. EOS But Plato never combined his economic ideas into a system, and never seems to have recognized that Trade is one of the great motive powers of the State and of the world. EOS He would make retail traders only of the inferior sort of citizens (Rep., Laws), though he remarks, quaintly enough (Laws), that 'if only the best men and the best women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to carry on retail trade, etc., then we should knew how pleasant and agreeable all these things are.' EOS But Plato would limit the use of fictions only by requiring that they should have a good moral effect, and that such a dangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed by the rulers alone and for great objects. EOS He was just beginning to be conscious that the past had a history; but he could see nothing beyond Homer and Hesiod. EOS Men only began to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them to be immoral. EOS These reflections tend to show that the difference between Plato and ourselves, though not unimportant, is not so great as might at first sight appear. EOS A singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the lie in the soul; this is connected with the Platonic and Socratic doctrine that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary. EOS For example, to represent God as false or immoral, or, according to Plato, as deluding men with appearances or as the author of evil; or again, to affirm with Protagoras that 'knowledge is sensation,' or that 'being is becoming,' or with Thrasymachus 'that might is right,' would have been regarded by Plato as a lie of this hateful sort. EOS Nor should our citizens be given to excess of laughter--'Such violent delights' are followed by a violent re-action. EOS Truth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as we were saying, is useless to the gods, and only useful to men as a medicine. EOS That is a lesson which Homer teaches in some places: 'The Achaeans marched on breathing prowess, in silent awe of their leaders;'--but a very different one in other places: 'O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog, but the heart of a stag.' EOS The same may be said about his praises of eating and drinking and his dread of starvation; also about the verses in which he tells of the rapturous loves of Zeus and Here, or of how Hephaestus once detained Ares and Aphrodite in a net on a similar occasion. EOS There is a nobler strain heard in the words:--'Endure, my soul, thou hast endured worse.' EOS Now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to come; and narrative is of three kinds, the simple, the imitative, and a composition of the two. EOS Now in the descriptive style there are few changes, but in the dramatic there are a great many. EOS Next as to the music. EOS There are four notes of the tetrachord, and there are three ratios of metre, 3/2, 2/2, 2/1, which have all their characteristics, and the feet have different characteristics as well as the rhythms. EOS But about this you and I must ask Damon, the great musician, who speaks, if I remember rightly, of a martial measure as well as of dactylic, trochaic, and iambic rhythms, which he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another, assigning to each the proper quantity. EOS Some defect in the latter may be excused, but not in the former. EOS True love is the daughter of temperance, and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of bodily pleasure. EOS This was the reason why Asclepius and his sons practised no such art. EOS Glaucon then asks Socrates whether the best physicians and the best judges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience of diseases and of crimes. EOS Socrates draws a distinction between the two professions. EOS How is he to be wise and also innocent? EOS The passionate disposition when it has too much gymnastic is hardened and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper which has too much music becomes enervated. EOS He who mingles them in harmonious concord is the true musician,--he shall be the presiding genius of our State. EOS They only of the citizens may not touch it, or be under the same roof with it, or drink from it; it is the accursed thing. EOS The religious and ethical aspect of Plato's education will hereafter be considered under a separate head. EOS Some lesser points may be more conveniently noticed in this place. EOS 1. EOS 2. EOS The connection in the Tragic Choruses and in the Greek lyric poets is not unfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was unable to draw out. EOS 3. EOS The Republic of Plato, like the Athens of Pericles, has an artistic as well as a political side. EOS He would probably have regarded any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the greatest of them. EOS In a remarkable passage of the Laws it is acknowledged that the evil may form a correct estimate of the good. EOS at first seemed to be a paradox, yet was afterwards ascertained to be a truth. EOS Every Greek state had a myth respecting its own origin; the Platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men. EOS Nor is there any use in arguing strictly either from a few chance words, or from the silence of Plato, or in drawing inferences which were beyond his vision. EOS Aristotle, in his criticism on the position of the lower classes, does not perceive that the poetical creation is 'like the air, invulnerable,' and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic (Pol.). EOS Two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest degree fanciful and ideal, and which suggest to him many reflections, are to be found in the third book of the Republic: first, the great power of music, so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us in modern times, when the art or science has been far more developed, and has found the secret of harmony, as well as of melody; secondly, the indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed to exercise over the body. EOS With this natural enthusiasm, which is felt by a few only, there seems to mingle in Plato a sort of Pythagorean reverence for numbers and numerical proportion to which Aristotle is a stranger. EOS Intervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law of their own, not dependent on the variations of sense. EOS And the mind has often a wonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness and calling out a hidden strength. EOS Reason and the desires, the intellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as to form a single human being. EOS They are ever parting, ever meeting; and the identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most part unnoticed by us. EOS And we all of us know which is the rightful superior. EOS Still even in the management of health, care and thought, continued over many years, may make us almost free agents, if we do not exact too much of ourselves, and if we acknowledge that all human freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of mind. EOS He does not recognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily disorders; and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by little are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe. EOS 7. EOS Lesser matters of style may be remarked. EOS Adeimantus said: 'Suppose a person to argue, Socrates, that you make your citizens miserable, and this by their own free-will; they are the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men, lands and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and are always mounting guard.' EOS If they are poor, they will be mean; if rich, luxurious and lazy; and in neither case contented. EOS 'But then how will our poor city be able to go to war against an enemy who has money?' EOS I am amused to hear you use the word 'state' of any but our own State. EOS For in every state there are two hostile nations, rich and poor, which you may set one against the other. EOS This is a matter of secondary importance, like the principle of transposition which was intimated in the parable of the earthborn men. EOS Far be it from us to enter into the particulars of legislation; let the guardians take care of education, and education will take care of all other things. EOS If you tell such persons that they must first alter their habits, then they grow angry; they are charming people. EOS 'Charming,--nay, the very reverse.' EOS Evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces, nor the state which is like them. EOS 'Yes, the men are as bad as the states.' EOS Nothing for us; but to Apollo the god of Delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all things--that is to say, religion. EOS They may be the happiest of men, but our principal aim in founding the State was not to make them happy. EOS But utility is not the historical basis of morality; nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas commonly occur to the mind. EOS to Gorgias and Philebus). EOS Yet here too we may observe that what we term expediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of human society. EOS They are the watchwords which all men use in matters of public policy, as well as in their private dealings; the peace of Europe may be said to depend upon them. EOS (4) The humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep, of the light active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least, of the 'charming' patients who are always making themselves worse; or again, the playful assumption that there is no State but our own; or the grave irony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six feet high because he is told so, and having nothing to measure with is to be pardoned for his ignorance--he is too amusing for us to be seriously angry with him. EOS 'That won't do,' replied Glaucon, 'you yourself promised to make the search and talked about the impiety of deserting justice.' EOS Colours dyed in this way become fixed, and no soap or lye will ever wash them out. EOS There are in cities whole classes--women, slaves and the like--who correspond to the worse, and a few only to the better; and in our State the former class are held under control by the latter. EOS Why, Glaucon, our dulness of scent is quite ludicrous! EOS Not that there is much harm in a carpenter trying to be a cobbler, or a cobbler transforming himself into a carpenter; but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his last and turning into a guardian or legislator, or when a single individual is trainer, warrior, legislator, all in one. EOS I do not say that as yet we are in a condition to arrive at a final conclusion. EOS Temperance appears to be the virtue of a part only, and one of three, whereas justice is a universal virtue of the whole soul. EOS To this universal conception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral nature of man, the still more universal conception of the good in the second education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to succeed. EOS The same thing in the same relation cannot be affected in two opposite ways. EOS But there is no impossibility in a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or in a top which is fixed on one spot going round upon its axis. EOS The counsellor and the warrior, the head and the arm, will act together in the town of Mansoul, and keep the desires in proper subjection. EOS And is not the reason of this that the several principles, whether in the state or in the individual, do their own business? EOS Moreover, our old division of labour, which required that there should be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what was to follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which begins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts harmoniously in every relation of life. EOS The question has become ridiculous. EOS And the state which corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have been describing, wherein reason rules under one of two names--monarchy and aristocracy. EOS The same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects. EOS This case therefore has to be excluded. EOS The psychology of Plato extends no further than the division of the soul into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent elements, which, as far as we know, was first made by him, and has been retained by Aristotle and succeeding ethical writers. EOS And to this vernacular use Plato himself in the Laws seems to revert, though not always. EOS We are tempted also to doubt whether Plato is right in supposing that an offender, however justly condemned, could be expected to acknowledge the justice of his sentence; this is the spirit of a philosopher or martyr rather than of a criminal. EOS How he would have filled up the sketch, or argued about such questions from a higher point of view, we can only conjecture. EOS The most certain and necessary truth was to Plato the universal; and to this he was always seeking to refer all knowledge or opinion, just as in modern times we seek to rest them on the opposite pole of induction and experience. EOS In the Sophist, where he is refuting the scepticism which maintained either that there was no such thing as predication, or that all might be predicated of all, he arrives at the conclusion that some ideas combine with some, but not all with all. EOS But he makes only one or two steps forward on this path; he nowhere attains to any connected system of ideas, or even to a knowledge of the most elementary relations of the sciences to one another. EOS Why? EOS Glaucon added, 'Yes, Socrates, and there is reason in spending the whole of life in such discussions; but pray, without more ado, tell us how this community is to be carried out, and how the interval between birth and education is to be filled up.' EOS is the first question. EOS What is desirable? EOS Socrates proceeds:--The guardians of our state are to be watch-dogs, as we have already said. EOS THERE was the difficulty, Glaucon, which made me unwilling to speak of family relations. EOS The argument is, that different natures have different uses, and the natures of men and women are said to differ. EOS Now why is such an inference erroneous? EOS 'Nay, I think that a considerable doubt will be entertained on both points.' EOS You, as legislator, have already selected the men; and now you shall select the women. EOS And whereas in other States members of the same government regard one of their colleagues as a friend and another as an enemy, in our State no man is a stranger to another; for every citizen is connected with every other by ties of blood, and these names and this way of speaking will have a corresponding reality--brother, father, sister, mother, repeated from infancy in the ears of children, will not be mere words. EOS And to the parents themselves, as to other animals, the sight of their young ones will prove a great incentive to bravery. EOS But what shall be done to the hero? EOS He shall be worshipped after death in the manner prescribed by the oracle; and not only he, but all other benefactors of the State who die in any other way, shall be admitted to the same honours. EOS No; for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing under the yoke of the barbarians. EOS Or shall the dead be despoiled? EOS The war is not against a whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men, women, and children, but only against a few guilty persons; when they are punished peace will be restored. EOS When you see the towering crest of the wave, I expect you to take pity. EOS Well, then, we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after justice, and the just man answered to the just State. EOS Would the picture of a perfectly beautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived? EOS 'Socrates, all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones, and therefore I would advise you to prepare an answer.' EOS Having the help of such a champion, I will do my best to maintain my position. EOS And by faculties I mean powers unseen and distinguishable only by the difference in their objects, as opinion and knowledge differ, since the one is liable to err, but the other is unerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties. EOS Everything is and is not, as in the old riddle--'A man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a bird with a stone and not a stone.' EOS The mind cannot be fixed on either alternative; and these ambiguous, intermediate, erring, half-lighted objects, which have a disorderly movement in the region between being and not-being, are the proper matter of opinion, as the immutable objects are the proper matter of knowledge. EOS First, there is the image of the waves, which serves for a sort of scheme or plan of the book. EOS Some defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the communistic plan. EOS Nothing is told us of the application of communism to the lower classes; nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of being made out. EOS Nor does he explain how the lots could be so manipulated by the legislature as to bring together the fairest and best. EOS I shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a hand I am at the invention of allegories. EOS Now the pilot is the philosopher--he whom in the parable they call star-gazer, and the mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom he is rendered useless. EOS Need I recall the original image of the philosopher? EOS The point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption in nature. EOS But what numberless causes tend to destroy these rare beings! EOS The philosopher follows the same analogy: he is either the best or the worst of all men. EOS For if he will not yield to opinion, there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death. EOS Think of all this and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity of phenomena. EOS There is another evil:--the world does not like to lose the gifted nature, and so they flatter the young (Alcibiades) into a magnificent opinion of his own capacity; the tall, proper youth begins to expand, and is dreaming of kingdoms and empires. EOS Vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts into her temple. EOS Small, then, is the remnant of genuine philosophers; there may be a few who are citizens of small states, in which politics are not worth thinking of, or who have been detained by Theages' bridle of ill health; for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique, and too rare to be worth mentioning. EOS This order of education should be reversed; it should begin with gymnastics in youth, and as the man strengthens, he should increase the gymnastics of his soul. EOS Who can hate a man who loves him? EOS Enough, my friend; but what is enough while anything remains wanting? EOS Again, the good must have reality; a man may desire the appearance of virtue, but he will not desire the appearance of good. EOS Did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses, requiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is light; without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all will be a blank? EOS Peace, I replied.) EOS The lower portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of shadows and reflections, and its upper and smaller portion will contain real objects in the world of nature or of art. EOS Whereas in the other division reason uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the idea of good, to which she fastens them, and then again descends, walking firmly in the region of ideas, and of ideas only, in her ascent as well as descent, and finally resting in them. EOS All his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom, which is the love of truth. EOS The ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique; there is not the same originality either in truth or error which characterized the Greeks. EOS The philosopher is no longer living in the unseen, nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance; nor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by regular stages to the idea of good. EOS The philosopher in modern times is one who fixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion, not on fragments or pictures of nature; on history, not on controversy; on the truths which are acknowledged by the few, not on the opinions of the many. EOS He is aware that mathematical studies are preliminary to almost every other; at the same time, he will not reduce all varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics. EOS And this quality in language impairs the force of an argument which has many steps. EOS The objection, though fairly met by Socrates in this particular instance, may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the Socratic mode of reasoning. EOS Adeimantus further argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts; for experience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues. EOS The man of genius has greater pains and greater pleasures, greater powers and greater weaknesses, and often a greater play of character than is to be found in ordinary men. EOS Yet the thesis, 'corruptio optimi pessima,' cannot be maintained generally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is corrupted. EOS The same double feeling respecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men. EOS Of the higher method of knowledge in Plato we have only a glimpse. EOS But at the end of the sixth book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which all ideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a connected whole which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is the test of truth. EOS He does not explain to us in detail the nature of the process. EOS Anticipations or divinations, or prophetic glimpses of truths whether concerning man or nature, seem to stand in the same relation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern inductive science. EOS 2. EOS Plato represents these ideals in a figure as belonging to another world; and in modern times the idea will sometimes seem to precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand of the artist. EOS He had observed the use of mathematics in education; they were the best preparation for higher studies. EOS For metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with mathematics; number and figure are the abstractions of time and space, not the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions. EOS The figurative association was mistaken for a real one; and thus the three latter divisions of the Platonic proportion were constructed. EOS He is also preparing the way, as his manner is, for the shadows of images at the beginning of the seventh book, and the imitation of an imitation in the tenth. EOS It was the cause of all things, the power by which they were brought into being. EOS It was the universal reason divested of a human personality. EOS The way to it was through the mathematical sciences, and these too were dependent on it. EOS The paraphrase which has just been given of it goes beyond the actual words of Plato. EOS We are beginning to realize what he saw darkly and at a distance. EOS At a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like the screen over which marionette players show their puppets. EOS But now imagine further, that they descend into their old habitations;--in that underground dwelling they will not see as well as their fellows, and will not be able to compete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall; there will be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and lost his eyes, and if they find anybody trying to set free and enlighten one of their number, they will put him to death, if they can catch him. EOS And this is conversion; other virtues are almost like bodily habits, and may be acquired in the same manner, but intelligence has a diviner life, and is indestructible, turning either to good or evil according to the direction given. EOS You should remember that our purpose in framing the State was not that our citizens should do what they like, but that they should serve the State for the common good of all. EOS For those who rule must not be those who are desirous to rule; and, if you can offer to our citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is, there will be a chance that the rich, not only in this world's goods, but in virtue and wisdom, may bear rule. EOS Our former education had two branches, gymnastic, which was occupied with the body, and music, the sister art, which infused a natural harmony into mind and literature; but neither of these sciences gave any promise of doing what we want. EOS 'Yes, certainly.' EOS he must have been a pretty sort of general indeed. EOS The retail use is not required by us; but as our guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the military one may be retained. EOS It is concerned, not with visible objects, but with abstract truth; for numbers are pure abstractions--the true arithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division. EOS When you divide, he insists that you are only multiplying; his 'one' is not material or resolvable into fractions, but an unvarying and absolute equality; and this proves the purely intellectual character of his study. EOS Yet the present mode of pursuing these studies, as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is mean and ridiculous; they are made to look downwards to the arts, and not upwards to eternal existence. EOS 'Every man is his own best friend.' EOS 'Very good, and now let us proceed to astronomy, about which I am willing to speak in your lofty strain. EOS 'That last,' he said, 'must be a marvellous thing.' EOS A thing, I replied, which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good. EOS What study do you mean--of the prelude, or what? EOS 'Certainly not. EOS And yet, Glaucon, is not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the intellectual world, and which was by us compared to the effort of sight, when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at the images which gave the shadows? EOS To him who is not a dialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in his grave before his is well waked up. EOS 'Certainly not the latter.' EOS For Solon is mistaken in saying that an old man can be always learning; youth is the time of study, and here we must remember that the mind is free and dainty, and, unlike the body, must not be made to work against the grain. EOS And afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of those who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction of ideas. EOS This is just what happens with a man's principles. EOS There are certain doctrines which he learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority over him. EOS He is seduced into the life of pleasure, and becomes a lawless person and a rogue. EOS A man of thirty does not run on in this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct. EOS Their first act will be to send away into the country all those who are more than ten years of age, and to proceed with those who are left...  At the commencement of the sixth book, Plato anticipated his explanation of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an allegory, in this, as in other passages, following the order which he prescribes in education, and proceeding from the concrete to the abstract. EOS The science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions. EOS The illusion was a natural one in that age and country. EOS The modern predecessors of Newton fell into errors equally great; and Plato can hardly be said to have been very far wrong, or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the subject, when we consider that the greater part of astronomy at the present day consists of abstract dynamics, by the help of which most astronomical discoveries have been made. EOS The second difficulty relates to Plato's conception of harmonics. EOS The den or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law (compare the description of the philosopher and lawyer in the Theaetetus), and the light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing influence on the minds of those who return to this lower world. EOS For among ourselves, too, there have been two sorts of Politicians or Statesmen, whose eyesight has become disordered in two different ways. EOS They have been intoxicated with great ideas, such as liberty, or equality, or the greatest happiness of the greatest number, or the brotherhood of humanity, and they no longer care to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or harmonized with the conditions of human life. EOS Suppose them to be sent into a larger world, to undertake some higher calling, from being tradesmen to turn generals or politicians, from being schoolmasters to become philosophers:--or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward light which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher idea of God and the existence of a spiritual world, by this sudden conversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset; and on the other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses still adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more comprehensive view of human things? EOS We too observe that when young men begin to criticise customary beliefs, or to analyse the constitution of human nature, they are apt to lose hold of solid principle (Greek). EOS Like the youth in the Philebus, they are ready to discourse to any one about a new philosophy. EOS They are generally the disciples of some eminent professor or sophist, whom they rather imitate than understand. EOS The distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also noticeable. EOS 'I should like to know of what constitutions you were speaking?' EOS 'And what will they say?' EOS For whereas divine creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation is in a number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and three intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating, dissimilating, and yet perfectly commensurate with each other. EOS In that respect, perhaps, but not in others. EOS And does not the analogy apply still more to the State? EOS The greatest evil of all is that a man may sell his property and have no place in the State; while there is one class which has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. EOS Like State, like man,--the change in the latter begins with the representative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his father, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and presently he sees him 'fallen from his high estate,' the victim of informers, dying in prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner. EOS Hence he leads a divided existence; in which the better desires mostly prevail. EOS But when he is contending for prizes and other distinctions, he is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren honour; in time of war he fights with a small part of his resources, and usually keeps his money and loses the victory. EOS Insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an oligarchy; and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may gain by the ruin of extravagant youth. EOS But the ruling class do not want remedies; they care only for money, and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the citizens. EOS The State is not one but many, like a bazaar at which you can buy anything. EOS Such is democracy;--a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government, distributing equality to equals and unequals alike. EOS The oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner:--The youth who has had a miserly bringing up, gets a taste of the drone's honey; he meets with wild companions, who introduce him to every new pleasure. EOS Tyranny springs from democracy much as democracy springs from oligarchy. EOS And this exclusive love of freedom and regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the change from democracy to tyranny. EOS Slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and there is no difference between men and women. EOS Such is the glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs. EOS Then follow informations and convictions for treason. EOS The people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from this root the tree of tyranny springs. EOS Then comes unpopularity; some of his old associates have the courage to oppose him. EOS And are not their praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason why we should exclude them from our State? EOS They may go to other cities, and gather the mob about them with fine words, and change commonwealths into tyrannies and democracies, receiving honours and rewards for their services; but the higher they and their friends ascend constitution hill, the more their honour will fail and become 'too asthmatic to mount.' EOS He begins by asking the point at which he digressed; and is thus led shortly to recapitulate the substance of the three former books, which also contain a parallel of the philosopher and the State. EOS The first of these declining States is timocracy, or the government of soldiers and lovers of honour, which answers to the Spartan State; this is a government of force, in which education is not inspired by the Muses, but imposed by the law, and in which all the finer elements of organization have disappeared. EOS The order of history appears to be different; first, in the Homeric times there is the royal or patriarchal form of government, which a century or two later was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth, and in which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary possession of land and power. EOS At first sight there appears to be a similar inversion in the last step of the Platonic succession; for tyranny, instead of being the natural end of democracy, in early Greek history appears rather as a stage leading to democracy; the reign of Peisistratus and his sons is an episode which comes between the legislation of Solon and the constitution of Cleisthenes; and some secret cause common to them all seems to have led the greater part of Hellas at her first appearance in the dawn of history, e.g. EOS The portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later Greek delighted to draw of Phalaris and Dionysius, in which, as in the lives of mediaeval saints or mythic heroes, the conduct and actions of one were attributed to another in order to fill up the outline. EOS His deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved for the tyrant, who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness, and who in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an almost impossible existence, without that remnant of good which, in Plato's opinion, was required to give power to evil (Book I). EOS This ideal of wickedness living in helpless misery, is the reverse of that other portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour, which first of all Thrasymachus, and afterwards the sons of Ariston had drawn, and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the good of his subjects. EOS In all of them excess--the excess first of wealth and then of freedom, is the element of decay. EOS Our hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an accurate study of the words themselves; on which a faint light is thrown by the parallel passage in the ninth book. EOS For the numbers 3, 4, 5, which represent the sides of the Pythagorean triangle, also denote the intervals of the scale. EOS The words (Greek), 'terms' or 'notes,' and (Greek), 'intervals,' are applicable to music as well as to number and figure. EOS by raising the power and extracting the root (as in the translation). EOS 8 and 27 = 2 cubed and 3 cubed; and conversely. EOS Thus we have (48 + 5 + 27) 100 = 1000 x 2 cubed. EOS ), Proclus (super prima Eucl. EOS Nor do I think that (Greek) can mean 'two incommensurables,' which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3, but rather, as the preceding clause implies, (Greek), i.e. EOS The first harmony of 400, as has been already remarked, probably represents the rulers; the second and oblong harmony of 7600, the people. EOS There is, however, a previous question of the nature and number of the appetites, which I should like to consider first. EOS Some of them are unlawful, and yet admit of being chastened and weakened in various degrees by the power of reason and law. EOS Even in good men there is such an irregular wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. EOS Well then, I fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries, and love will be the lord and master of the house. EOS When there is no more to be got out of them, he turns burglar or pickpocket, or robs a temple. EOS But in time of peace they stay at home and do mischief; they are the thieves, footpads, cut-purses, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak, they turn false-witnesses and informers. EOS The State will be poor and full of misery and sorrow; and the man's soul will also be poor and full of sorrows, and he will be the most miserable of men. EOS 'There I suspect that you are right.' EOS Say rather, 'I am sure;' conjecture is out of place in an enquiry of this nature. EOS But why? EOS This is our first proof. EOS The second is derived from the three kinds of pleasure, which answer to the three elements of the soul--reason, passion, desire; under which last is comprehended avarice as well as sensual appetite, while passion includes ambition, party-feeling, love of reputation. EOS The ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour; whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth, and will call other pleasures necessary rather than good. EOS And so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the rational part of the soul, and a life passed in such pleasure is the pleasantest. EOS Twice has the just man overthrown the unjust--once more, as in an Olympian contest, first offering up a prayer to the saviour Zeus, let him try a fall. EOS Let us examine this: Is not pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state which is neither? EOS And these are not the only pleasures, for there are others which have no preceding pains. EOS The invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable and mortal, and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth. EOS Their pleasures are mere shadows of pleasure, mixed with pain, coloured and intensified by contrast, and therefore intensely desired; and men go fighting about them, as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at Troy, because they know not the truth. EOS But now, let us reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally in error. EOS And will he sell his own fairer and diviner part without any compunction to the most godless and foul? EOS The real disgrace of handicraft arts is, that those who are engaged in them have to flatter, instead of mastering their desires; therefore we say that they should be placed under the control of the better principle in another because they have none in themselves; not, as Thrasymachus imagined, to the injury of the subjects, but for their good. EOS If he had been punished, the brute within him would have been silenced, and the gentler element liberated; and he would have united temperance, justice, and wisdom in his soul--a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts. EOS For the same reason he will only accept such honours as will make him a better man; any others he will decline. EOS The most noticeable points in the 9th Book of the Republic are:--(1) the account of pleasure; (2) the number of the interval which divides the king from the tyrant; (3) the pattern which is in heaven. EOS He dwells upon the relative and unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion which arises out of the contrast of pleasure and pain, pointing out the superiority of the pleasures of reason, which are at rest, over the fleeting pleasures of sense and emotion. EOS Thus, in his treatment of pleasure, as in many other subjects, the philosophy of Plato is 'sawn up into quantities' by Aristotle; the analysis which was originally made by him became in the next generation the foundation of further technical distinctions. EOS Neither do we like to admit that the pleasures of knowledge, though more elevating, are not more lasting than other pleasures, and are almost equally dependent on the accidents of our bodily state (Introduction to Philebus). EOS 'It is not easy to estimate the loss of the tyrant, except perhaps in this way,' says Plato. EOS But this is not so much as saying, in homely phrase, 'They are a thousand miles asunder.' EOS There is some difficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained; the oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and aristocratical, and the tyrant in the third degree from the oligarchical; but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square and to count the oligarch twice over, thus reckoning them not as = 5 but as = 9. EOS That might very well be, for the duller often sees better than the keener eye. EOS Then suppose that we begin in our old fashion, with the doctrine of universals. EOS And is there not a maker of the works of all workmen, who makes not only vessels but plants and animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things in heaven and under the earth? EOS But do you not see that there is a sense in which you could do the same? EOS 'Yes, but only in appearance.' EOS The painter imitates not the original bed, but the bed made by the carpenter. EOS Suppose now that somebody came to us and told us, how he had met a man who knew all that everybody knows, and better than anybody:--should we not infer him to be a simpleton who, having no discernment of truth and falsehood, had met with a wizard or enchanter, whom he fancied to be all-wise? EOS 'Very true.' EOS Or was any war ever carried on by your counsels? EOS For as a painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a cobbler without any practice in cobbling, so the poet can delineate any art in the colours of language, and give harmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the general; and you know how mere narration, when deprived of the ornaments of metre, is like a face which has lost the beauty of youth and never had any other. EOS Thus we have three arts: one of use, another of invention, a third of imitation; and the user furnishes the rule to the two others. EOS Feeling would lead him to indulge his sorrow, but reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he cannot know whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing is of any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good counsel. EOS And the better part of us is ready to follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and distraction at the recollection of our troubles. EOS But we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment--the power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. EOS But we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes beyond hymns to the Gods and praises of famous men. EOS We will remind her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of which there are many traces in the writings of the poets, such as the saying of 'the she-dog, yelping at her mistress,' and 'the philosophers who are ready to circumvent Zeus,' and 'the philosophers who are paupers.' EOS We confess her charms; but if she cannot show that she is useful as well as delightful, like rational lovers, we must renounce our love, though endeared to us by early associations. EOS In all things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy them, nothing else will. EOS Neither is the soul variable and diverse; for that which is immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition. EOS If we would conceive her truly, and so behold justice and injustice in their own nature, she must be viewed by the light of reason pure as at birth, or as she is reflected in philosophy when holding converse with the divine and immortal and eternal. EOS In her present condition we see her only like the sea-god Glaucus, bruised and maimed in the sea which is the world, and covered with shells and stones which are incrusted upon her from the entertainments of earth. EOS I granted, for the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might perhaps escape the knowledge of Gods and men, although this was really impossible. EOS And what shall we say of men? EOS Is not honesty the best policy? EOS 'I should like to hear about them.' EOS And there were judges sitting in the intermediate space, bidding the just ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand, having the seal of their judgment set upon them before, while the unjust, having the seal behind, were bidden to descend by the way on the left hand. EOS And he beheld and saw the souls departing after judgment at either chasm; some who came from earth, were worn and travel-stained; others, who came from heaven, were clean and bright. EOS One day more brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column of light which binds together the whole universe. EOS On their arrival the pilgrims went to Lachesis, and there was an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees lots, and samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: 'Mortal souls, hear the words of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. EOS And a man must take with him an iron sense of truth and right into the world below, that there too he may remain undazzled by wealth or the allurements of evil, and be determined to avoid the extremes and choose the mean. EOS For this, as the messenger reported the interpreter to have said, is the true happiness of man; and any one, as he proclaimed, may, if he choose with understanding, have a good lot, even though he come last. EOS He was one of those who had come from heaven, and in his previous life had been a citizen of a well-ordered State, but he had only habit and no philosophy. EOS He first of all brought them under the hand of Clotho, and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand; from her they were carried to Atropos, who made the threads irreversible; whence, without turning round, they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness and rested at evening by the river Unmindful, whose water could not be retained in any vessel; of this they had all to drink a certain quantity--some of them drank more than was required, and he who drank forgot all things. EOS There was no 'second or third' to Aeschylus and Sophocles in the generation which followed them. EOS Taking this view Plato is more decided in his expulsion of the dramatic than of the epic poets, though he must have known that the Greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of virtue and patriotism, to which nothing in Homer can be compared. EOS For there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of the lower--thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by ourselves, may find an utterance in the words of poets. EOS The poets are on a level with their own age, but not on a level with Socrates and Plato; and he was well aware that Homer and Hesiod could not be made a rule of life by any process of legitimate interpretation; his ironical use of them is in fact a denial of their authority; he saw, too, that the poets were not critics--as he says in the Apology, 'Any one was a better interpreter of their writings than they were themselves. EOS Thus from many points of view there is an antagonism between Plato and the poets, which was foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry. EOS There is no difficulty in seeing that this is an illusion; for there is no more error or variation in an individual man, horse, bed, etc., than in the class man, horse, bed, etc. EOS Had he attained to any clear conception of the individual, which is the synthesis of the universal and the particular; or had he been able to distinguish between opinion and sensation, which the ambiguity of the words (Greek) and the like, tended to confuse, he would not have denied truth to the particulars of sense. EOS There is another count put into the indictment against them by Plato, that they are the friends of the tyrant, and bask in the sunshine of his patronage. EOS Plato is thinking in the first instance of Greek poets who had graced the courts of Dionysius or Archelaus: and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their prostitution of the Tragic Muse in the praises of tyranny. EOS But his prophetic eye extends beyond them to the false teachers of other ages who are the creatures of the government under which they live. EOS For the emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves, and are not most likely to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them, but by the moderate indulgence of them. EOS And the vocation of art is to present thought in the form of feeling, to enlist the feelings on the side of reason, to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to suggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language is incapable of attaining. EOS In the present stage of the human mind, poetry and other forms of fiction may certainly be regarded as a good. EOS But may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some day exhausted? EOS It is possible to conceive a mental state in which all artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect expression, either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical ideal. EOS Shakespeare has taught us how great men should speak and act; he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth; he has ennobled the human mind, but, like Homer (Rep.), he 'has left no way of life.' EOS Through the innermost or eighth of these, which is the moon, is passed the spindle; but it is doubtful whether this is the continuation of the column of light, from which the pilgrims contemplate the heavens; the words of Plato imply that they are connected, but not the same. EOS The orrery or picture of the heavens given in the Republic differs in its mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the other in the Timaeus. EOS The relative thickness of the rims is perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the planets. EOS Plato probably intended to represent the earth, from which Er and his companions are viewing the heavens, as stationary in place; but whether or not herself revolving, unless this is implied in the revolution of the axis, is uncertain (Timaeus). EOS But Plato is no doubt led to imagine that the planets have an opposite motion to that of the fixed stars, in order to account for their appearances in the heavens. EOS He who was moderately fortunate in the number of the lot--even the very last comer--might have a good life if he chose with wisdom. EOS 'Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her.' EOS But within the walls of necessity there is an open space in which he is his own master, and can study for himself the effects which the variously compounded gifts of nature or fortune have upon the soul, and act accordingly. EOS This is confirmed by the authority of Eryximachus the physician, who further proposes that instead of listening to the flute-girl and her 'noise' they shall make speeches in honour of love, one after another, going from left to right in the order in which they are reclining at the table. EOS All of them agree to this proposal, and Phaedrus, who is the 'father' of the idea, which he has previously communicated to Eryximachus, begins as follows:--  He descants first of all upon the antiquity of love, which is proved by the authority of the poets; secondly upon the benefits which love gives to man. EOS And there have been true loves not only of men but of women also. EOS The love of Achilles, like that of Alcestis, was courageous and true; for he was willing to avenge his lover Patroclus, although he knew that his own death would immediately follow: and the gods, who honour the love of the beloved above that of the lover, rewarded him, and sent him to the islands of the blest. EOS The vulgar love of the body which takes wing and flies away when the bloom of youth is over, is disgraceful, and so is the interested love of power or wealth; but the love of the noble mind is lasting. EOS Nor is there any disgrace to a disinterested lover in being deceived: but the interested lover is doubly disgraced, for if he loses his love he loses his character; whereas the noble love of the other remains the same, although the object of his love is unworthy: for nothing can be nobler than love for the sake of virtue. EOS The knowledge of these elements of love and discord in the heavenly bodies is termed astronomy, in the relations of men towards gods and parents is called divination. EOS Aristophanes is the next speaker:--  He professes to open a new vein of discourse, in which he begins by treating of the origin of human nature. EOS The sexes were originally three, men, women, and the union of the two; and they were made round--having four hands, four feet, two faces on a round neck, and the rest to correspond. EOS He spake, and split them as you might split an egg with an hair; and when this was done, he told Apollo to give their faces a twist and re-arrange their persons, taking out the wrinkles and tying the skin in a knot about the navel. EOS The pair are inseparable and live together in pure and manly affection; yet they cannot tell what they want of one another. EOS The turn of Socrates comes next. EOS And love is not of beauty only, but of birth in beauty; this is the principle of immortality in a mortal creature. EOS But why again does this extend not only to men but also to animals? EOS The company applaud the speech of Socrates, and Aristophanes is about to say something, when suddenly a band of revellers breaks into the court, and the voice of Alcibiades is heard asking for Agathon. EOS He narrates the failure of his design. EOS He is the most wonderful of human beings, and absolutely unlike anyone but a satyr. EOS If it be true that there are more things in the Symposium of Plato than any commentator has dreamed of, it is also true that many things have been imagined which are not really to be found there. EOS In an age when man was seeking for an expression of the world around him, the conception of love greatly affected him. EOS One of the first distinctions of language and of mythology was that of gender; and at a later period the ancient physicist, anticipating modern science, saw, or thought that he saw, a sex in plants; there were elective affinities among the elements, marriages of earth and heaven. EOS But they are not to be regarded as the stages of an idea, rising above one another to a climax. EOS Nic. EOS So naturally does Plato mingle jest and earnest, truth and opinion in the same work. EOS We may also remark that Aristodemus is called 'the little' in Xenophon's Memorabilia (compare Symp.). EOS The speech of Phaedrus is also described as the mythological, that of Pausanias as the political, that of Eryximachus as the scientific, that of Aristophanes as the artistic (! EOS 'Would you desire better witness?' EOS We may observe, by the way, (1) how the very appearance of Aristodemus by himself is a sufficient indication to Agathon that Socrates has been left behind; also, (2) how the courtesy of Agathon anticipates the excuse which Socrates was to have made on Aristodemus' behalf for coming uninvited; (3) how the story of the fit or trance of Socrates is confirmed by the mention which Alcibiades makes of a similar fit of abstraction occurring when he was serving with the army at Potidaea; like (4) the drinking powers of Socrates and his love of the fair, which receive a similar attestation in the concluding scene; or the attachment of Aristodemus, who is not forgotten when Socrates takes his departure. EOS This is still more marked in the speech of Pausanias which follows; and which is at once hyperlogical in form and also extremely confused and pedantic. EOS Plato is attacking the logical feebleness of the sophists and rhetoricians, through their pupils, not forgetting by the way to satirize the monotonous and unmeaning rhythms which Prodicus and others were introducing into Attic prose (compare Protag.). EOS This is done partly to avoid monotony, partly for the sake of making Aristophanes 'the cause of wit in others,' and also in order to bring the comic and tragic poet into juxtaposition, as if by accident. EOS It is the speech of the tragic poet and a sort of poem, like tragedy, moving among the gods of Olympus, and not among the elder or Orphic deities. EOS In the idea of the antiquity of love he cannot agree; love is not of the olden time, but present and youthful ever. EOS Agathon contributes the distinction between love and the works of love, and also hints incidentally that love is always of beauty, which Socrates afterwards raises into a principle. EOS From Phaedrus he takes the thought that love is stronger than death; from Pausanias, that the true love is akin to intellect and political activity; from Eryximachus, that love is a universal phenomenon and the great power of nature; from Aristophanes, that love is the child of want, and is not merely the love of the congenial or of the whole, but (as he adds) of the good; from Agathon, that love is of beauty, not however of beauty only, but of birth in beauty. EOS This piece of dialectics is ascribed to Diotima, who has already urged upon Socrates the argument which he urges against Agathon. EOS The fallacy seems to arise out of a confusion between the abstract ideas of good and beauty, which do not admit of degrees, and their partial realization in individuals. EOS As the Christian might speak of hungering and thirsting after righteousness; or of divine loves under the figure of human (compare Eph. EOS The first tumult of the affections was not wholly subdued; there were longings of a creature moving about in worlds not realized, which no art could satisfy. EOS The union of the greatest comprehension of knowledge and the burning intensity of love is a contradiction in nature, which may have existed in a far-off primeval age in the mind of some Hebrew prophet or other Eastern sage, but has now become an imagination only. EOS The state of his affections towards Socrates, unintelligible to us and perverted as they appear, affords an illustration of the power ascribed to the loves of man in the speech of Pausanias. EOS He does not suppose his feelings to be peculiar to himself: there are several other persons in the company who have been equally in love with Socrates, and like himself have been deceived by him. EOS The fault of taste, which to us is so glaring and which was recognized by the Greeks of a later age (Athenaeus), was not perceived by Plato himself. EOS The passion of love took the spurious form of an enthusiasm for the ideal of beauty--a worship as of some godlike image of an Apollo or Antinous. EOS It is observable that Plato never in the least degree excuses the depraved love of the body (compare Charm. EOS ), nor is there any Greek writer of mark who condones or approves such connexions. EOS False sentiment is found in the Lyric and Elegiac poets; and in mythology 'the greatest of the Gods' (Rep.) is not exempt from evil imputations. EOS But the morals of a nation are not to be judged of wholly by its literature. EOS Nor should we be right in inferring from the prevalence of any one vice or corruption that a state or individual was demoralized in their whole character. EOS Not only has the corruption of the best been sometimes thought to be the worst, but it may be remarked that this very excess of evil has been the stimulus to good (compare Plato, Laws, where he says that in the most corrupt cities individuals are to be found beyond all praise). EOS Cimon, Alcibiades, Critias, Demosthenes, Epaminondas: several of the Roman emperors were assailed by similar weapons which have been used even in our own day against statesmen of the highest character. EOS It is likely that every religion in the world has used words or practised rites in one age, which have become distasteful or repugnant to another. EOS Among the Romans, and also among barbarians, such as the Celts and Persians, there is no trace of such attachments existing in any noble or virtuous form. EOS Timarchum.) EOS He is the impersonation of lawlessness--'the lion's whelp, who ought not to be reared in the city,' yet not without a certain generosity which gained the hearts of men,--strangely fascinated by Socrates, and possessed of a genius which might have been either the destruction or salvation of Athens. EOS He seems to have been present to the mind of Plato in the description of the democratic man of the Republic (compare also Alcibiades 1). EOS The Symposium cannot therefore be regarded as a youthful work. EOS Plato does not go on to ask whether the individual is absorbed in the sea of light and beauty or retains his personality. EOS For the day before yesterday I was coming from my own home at Phalerum to the city, and one of my acquaintance, who had caught a sight of me from behind, calling out playfully in the distance, said: Apollodorus, O thou Phalerian (Probably a play of words on (Greek), 'bald-headed.') EOS There was a time when I was running about the world, fancying myself to be well employed, but I was really a most wretched being, no better than you are now. EOS COMPANION: I see, Apollodorus, that you are just the same--always speaking evil of yourself, and of others; and I do believe that you pity all mankind, with the exception of Socrates, yourself first of all, true in this to your old name, which, however deserved, I know not how you acquired, of Apollodorus the madman; for you are always raging against yourself and everybody but Socrates. EOS What say you to going with me unasked? EOS 'Two going together,'  he replied, in Homeric fashion, one or other of them may invent an excuse by the way (Iliad). EOS This was the style of their conversation as they went along. EOS But on this occasion imagine that you are our hosts, and that I and the company are your guests; treat us well, and then we shall commend you.' EOS Agathon, who was reclining alone at the end of the table, begged that he would take the place next to him; that 'I may touch you,' he said, 'and have the benefit of that wise thought which came into your mind in the portico, and is now in your possession; for I am certain that you would not have come away until you had found what you sought.' EOS I can assure you that I feel severely the effect of yesterday's potations, and must have time to recover; and I suspect that most of you are in the same predicament, for you were of the party yesterday. EOS Consider then: How can the drinking be made easiest? EOS To-day let us have conversation instead; and, if you will allow me, I will tell you what sort of conversation. EOS If you agree with me, there will be no lack of conversation; for I mean to propose that each of us in turn, going from left to right, shall make a speech in honour of Love. EOS No one will vote against you, Eryximachus, said Socrates. EOS Also Parmenides sings of Generation:  'First in the train of gods, he fashioned Love.' EOS Thus numerous are the witnesses who acknowledge Love to be the eldest of the gods. EOS For what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? EOS And greatly as the gods honour the virtue of love, still the return of love on the part of the beloved to the lover is more admired and valued and rewarded by them, for the lover is more divine; because he is inspired by God. EOS Those who are inspired by this love turn to the male, and delight in him who is the more valiant and intelligent nature; any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts in the very character of their attachments. EOS For they love not boys, but intelligent beings whose reason is beginning to be developed, much about the time at which their beards begin to grow. EOS These are the persons who bring a reproach on love; and some have been led to deny the lawfulness of such attachments because they see the impropriety and evil of them; for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfully done can justly be censured. EOS And, therefore, the ill-repute into which these attachments have fallen is to be ascribed to the evil condition of those who make them to be ill-reputed; that is to say, to the self-seeking of the governors and the cowardice of the governed; on the other hand, the indiscriminate honour which is given to them in some countries is attributable to the laziness of those who hold this opinion of them. EOS But, as I was saying at first, the truth as I imagine is, that whether such practices are honourable or whether they are dishonourable is not a simple question; they are honourable to him who follows them honourably, dishonourable to him who follows them dishonourably. EOS There is dishonour in yielding to the evil, or in an evil manner; but there is honour in yielding to the good, or in an honourable manner. EOS The custom of our country would have both of them proven well and truly, and would have us yield to the one sort of lover and avoid the other, and therefore encourages some to pursue, and others to fly; testing both the lover and beloved in contests and trials, until they show to which of the two classes they respectively belong. EOS And this is the reason why, in the first place, a hasty attachment is held to be dishonourable, because time is the true test of this as of most other things; and secondly there is a dishonour in being overcome by the love of money, or of wealth, or of political power, whether a man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them, or, having experienced the benefits of money and political corruption, is unable to rise above the seductions of them. EOS For we have a custom, and according to our custom any one who does service to another under the idea that he will be improved by him either in wisdom, or in some other particular of virtue--such a voluntary service, I say, is not to be regarded as a dishonour, and is not open to the charge of flattery. EOS For when the lover and beloved come together, having each of them a law, and the lover thinks that he is right in doing any service which he can to his gracious loving one; and the other that he is right in showing any kindness which he can to him who is making him wise and good; the one capable of communicating wisdom and virtue, the other seeking to acquire them with a view to education and wisdom, when the two laws of love are fulfilled and meet in one--then, and then only, may the beloved yield with honour to the lover. EOS This is that love which is the love of the heavenly godess, and is heavenly, and of great price to individuals and cities, making the lover and the beloved alike eager in the work of their own improvement. EOS I will do both, said Eryximachus: I will speak in your turn, and do you speak in mine; and while I am speaking let me recommend you to hold your breath, and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough is no better, then gargle with a little water; and if it still continues, tickle your nose with something and sneeze; and if you sneeze once or twice, even the most violent hiccough is sure to go. EOS But my art further informs me that the double love is not merely an affection of the soul of man towards the fair, or towards anything, but is to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions of the earth, and I may say in all that is; such is the conclusion which I seem to have gathered from my own art of medicine, whence I learn how great and wonderful and universal is the deity of love, whose empire extends over all things, divine as well as human. EOS I will unsay my words; but do you please not to watch me, as I fear that in the speech which I am about to make, instead of others laughing with me, which is to the manner born of our muse and would be all the better, I shall only be laughed at by them. EOS Mankind, he said, judging by their neglect of him, have never, as I think, at all understood the power of Love. EOS I will try to describe his power to you, and you shall teach the rest of the world what I am teaching you. EOS In the second place, the primeval man was round, his back and sides forming a circle; and he had four hands and four feet, one head with two faces, looking opposite ways, set on a round neck and precisely alike; also four ears, two privy members, and the remainder to correspond. EOS They shall walk upright on two legs, and if they continue insolent and will not be quiet, I will split them again and they shall hop about on a single leg.' EOS They were being destroyed, when Zeus in pity of them invented a new plan: he turned the parts of generation round to the front, for this had not been always their position, and they sowed the seed no longer as hitherto like grasshoppers in the ground, but in one another; and after the transposition the male generated in the female in order that by the mutual embraces of man and woman they might breed, and the race might continue; or if man came to man they might be satisfied, and rest, and go their ways to the business of life: so ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, making one of two, and healing the state of man. EOS Each of us when separated, having one side only, like a flat fish, is but the indenture of a man, and he is always looking for his other half. EOS And suppose further, that when he saw their perplexity he said: 'Do you desire to be wholly one; always day and night to be in one another's company? EOS And if this would be best of all, the best in the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearest approach to such an union; and that will be the attainment of a congenial love. EOS But, for all that, I am not without hopes. EOS And I am quite aware that if you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise, you would care for their opinion much more than for that of the many. EOS Now I love to hear him talk; but just at present I must not forget the encomium on Love which I ought to receive from him and from every one. EOS And he is the fairest: for, in the first place, he is the youngest, and of his youth he is himself the witness, fleeing out of the way of age, who is swift enough, swifter truly than most of us like:--Love hates him and will not come near him; but youth and love live and move together--like to like, as the proverb says. EOS For all men in all things serve him of their own free will, and where there is voluntary agreement, there, as the laws which are the lords of the city say, is justice. EOS And not only is he just but exceedingly temperate, for Temperance is the acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires, and no pleasure ever masters Love; he is their master and they are his servants; and if he conquers them he must be temperate indeed. EOS And if he conquers the bravest of all others, he must be himself the bravest. EOS Who will deny that the creation of the animals is his doing? EOS And so Love set in order the empire of the gods--the love of beauty, as is evident, for with deformity Love has no concern. EOS I am especially struck with the beauty of the concluding words--who could listen to them without amazement? EOS And then I perceived how foolish I had been in consenting to take my turn with you in praising love, and saying that I too was a master of the art, when I really had no conception how anything ought to be praised. EOS Then, he added, let me have your permission first to ask Agathon a few more questions, in order that I may take his admissions as the premisses of my discourse. EOS Socrates then proceeded as follows:--  In the magnificent oration which you have just uttered, I think that you were right, my dear Agathon, in proposing to speak of the nature of Love first and afterwards of his works--that is a way of beginning which I very much approve. EOS to which you would find no difficulty in replying, of a son or daughter: and the answer would be right. EOS And you would say the same of a mother? EOS Yet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my meaning: Is not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of something? EOS That is, of a brother or sister? EOS Keep in mind what this is, and tell me what I want to know--whether Love desires that of which love is. EOS Yes, surely. EOS I agree with you, said Agathon. EOS He must agree with us--must he not? EOS Yes, my friend, and the remark was a just one. EOS True, he said. EOS And now, taking my leave of you, I would rehearse a tale of love which I heard from Diotima of Mantineia (compare 1 Alcibiades), a woman wise in this and in many other kinds of knowledge, who in the days of old, when the Athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague, delayed the disease ten years. EOS First I said to her in nearly the same words which he used to me, that Love was a mighty god, and likewise fair; and she proved to me as I proved to him that, by my own showing, Love was neither fair nor good. EOS 'And what may that be?' EOS 'Do not then insist,' she said, 'that what is not fair is of necessity foul, or what is not good evil; or infer that because love is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil; for he is in a mean between them.' EOS 'And you admitted that Love, because he was in want, desires those good and fair things of which he is in want?' EOS 'But how can he be a god who has no portion in what is either good or fair?' EOS 'No.' EOS 'A child may answer that question,' she replied; 'they are those who are in a mean between the two; Love is one of them. EOS The error in your conception of him was very natural, and as I imagine from what you say, has arisen out of a confusion of love and the beloved, which made you think that love was all beautiful. EOS But some one will say: Of the beautiful in what, Socrates and Diotima?--or rather let me put the question more clearly, and ask: When a man loves the beautiful, what does he desire?' EOS 'And is this wish and this desire common to all? EOS For there is nothing which men love but the good. EOS 'Yes,' I said. EOS 'To which must be added that they love the possession of the good?' EOS 'Yes, that must be added.' EOS 'And not only the possession, but the everlasting possession of the good?' EOS 'That is most true.' EOS 'The love of generation and of birth in beauty.' EOS And I remember her once saying to me, 'What is the cause, Socrates, of love, and the attendant desire? EOS Which is true not only of the body, but also of the soul, whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears, never remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and going; and equally true of knowledge, and what is still more surprising to us mortals, not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay, so that in respect of them we are never the same; but each of them individually experiences a like change. EOS And she answered with all the authority of an accomplished sophist: 'Of that, Socrates, you may be assured;--think only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame. EOS And such creators are poets and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor. EOS So that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend him, and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws, and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and that personal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences, that he may see their beauty, being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution, himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he grows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. EOS And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty is. EOS But what if man had eyes to see the true beauty--the divine beauty, I mean, pure and clear and unalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human life--thither looking, and holding converse with the true beauty simple and divine? EOS 'Will you have a very drunken man as a companion of your revels? EOS Will you laugh at me because I am drunk? EOS etc.)? EOS Thereupon he was led in by the people who were with him; and as he was being led, intending to crown Agathon, he took the ribands from his own head and held them in front of his eyes; he was thus prevented from seeing Socrates, who made way for him, and Alcibiades took the vacant place between Agathon and Socrates, and in taking the place he embraced Agathon and crowned him. EOS said Alcibiades, turning round and starting up as he caught sight of Socrates.
