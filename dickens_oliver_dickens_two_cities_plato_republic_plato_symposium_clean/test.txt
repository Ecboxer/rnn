XIII  SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER,           CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED,           APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY      XIV  COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR.           BROWNLOW'S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG           UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND       XV  SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND           MISS NANCY WERE      XVI  RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED           BY NANCY     XVII  OLIVER'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO           LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION    XVIII  HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS           REPUTABLE FRIENDS      XIX  IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON       XX  WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES      XXI  THE EXPEDITION     XXII  THE BURGLARY    XXIII  WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN           MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE           SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS     XXIV  TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. EOS For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country. EOS interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction. EOS 'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! EOS They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. EOS said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child. EOS 'Poor dear!' EOS Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. EOS Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. EOS The children were neat and clean to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have! EOS Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled. EOS 'Now don't you be offended at what I'm a going to say,' observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. EOS 'Just a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.' EOS inquired the beadle. EOS 'Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. EOS Mann?' EOS (Here she set down the glass.) EOS 'You feel as a mother, Mrs. EOS 'I, Mrs. Mann. EOS I have come out myself to take him there. EOS 'Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,' said Mrs. Mann. EOS Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table. EOS said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice. EOS With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years. EOS 'Boy,' said the gentleman in the high chair, 'listen to me. EOS inquired poor Oliver. EOS 'The boy _is_ a fool--I thought he was,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS 'Hush!' EOS said the gentleman who had spoken first. EOS And to be sure it was very extraordinary. EOS 'Yes, sir,' stammered the boy. EOS It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of _him_. EOS Poor Oliver! EOS But they had. EOS said the board, looking very knowing; 'we are the fellows to set this to rights; we'll stop it all, in no time.' EOS So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. EOS But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies. EOS The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon. EOS The evening arrived; the boys took their places. EOS The master, in his cook's uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons. EOS The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. EOS He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:  'Please, sir, I want some more.' EOS 'What!' EOS 'Please, sir,' replied Oliver, 'I want some more.' EOS Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion. EOS Let it not be supposed by the enemies of 'the system,' that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation. EOS As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. EOS 'Wo--o!' EOS The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward. EOS The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room. EOS Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. EOS So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS 'Ay, my man,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile. EOS It's humane too, gen'l'men, acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes 'em struggle to hextricate theirselves.' EOS At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:  'We have considered your proposition, and we don't approve of it.' EOS 'Decidedly not,' added the other members. EOS 'So you won't let me have him, gen'l'men?' EOS ha!' EOS The bargain was made. EOS 'The kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to 'prentice' you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!--three pound ten, Oliver!--seventy shillins--one hundred and forty sixpences!--and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.' EOS Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't cry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.' EOS It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already. EOS On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. EOS It was a large room, with a great window. EOS Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about. EOS The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk. EOS said the old gentleman. EOS 'Well,' said the old gentleman, 'I suppose he's fond of chimney-sweeping?' EOS 'If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he'd run away simultaneous, your worship,' replied Bumble. EOS 'I hope I am, sir,' said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer. EOS 'Hold your tongue, Beadle,' said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective. EOS 'I beg your worship's pardon,' said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright. EOS Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. EOS That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. EOS The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him. EOS CHAPTER IV  OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE  In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea. EOS 'I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,' said the undertaker. EOS he!' EOS A porochial 'prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? EOS I never noticed it before.' EOS Mr. Bumble nodded. EOS Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice:  'Well; what about the boy?' EOS 'Oh!' EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice. EOS As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek. EOS It was followed by another, and another. EOS Of _all_ the ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the--'  'No, no, sir,' sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well-known cane; 'no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir! EOS said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; 'is that you, Bumble?' EOS 'Here! EOS I've brought the boy.' EOS said the undertaker:  raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. EOS Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance. EOS But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry--he'll grow.' EOS With this, the undertaker's wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated 'kitchen'; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair. EOS 'Here, Charlotte,' said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, 'give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. EOS 'Well,' said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his future appetite: 'have you done?' EOS GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER'S BUSINESS  Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand. EOS The shop was close and hot. EOS The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart. EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'How old are yer?' EOS Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. EOS 'I kicked,' replied the charity-boy. EOS 'Did you want a coffin, sir?' EOS Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that 'he'd catch it,' condescended to help him. EOS Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover of the bread-pan. EOS 'Lor, Noah!' EOS said Noah. EOS 'Not at all, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. EOS 'I thought you didn't want to hear, my dear. EOS After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded. EOS 'A very good-looking boy, that, my dear.' EOS 'He need be, for he eats enough,' observed the lady. EOS Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady's part, proceeded. EOS The occasion was not long in coming. EOS 'For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,' replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like himself, was very corpulent. EOS Bumble shook his head, as he replied, 'Obstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry; very obstinate. EOS 'Oh, it's sickening,' replied the beadle. EOS 'So it is,' acquiesced the undertaker. EOS Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won't suit his wife's complaint, and so she shan't take it--says she shan't take it, sir! EOS Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before--sent 'em for nothing, with a blackin'-bottle in,--and he sends back word that she shan't take it, sir!' EOS ejaculated the beadle. EOS said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street. EOS Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission. EOS They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search. EOS The kennel was stagnant and filthy. EOS He stepped in; Oliver followed him. EOS Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse. EOS They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside. EOS Damn you, keep back, if you've a life to lose!' EOS They starved her!' EOS 'Lord, Lord! EOS Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! EOS 'Stop, stop!' EOS Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold. EOS Shall we have some bread, dear?' EOS 'Fill up!' EOS 'Come, my good fellow!' EOS said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. EOS Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible. EOS He got rather personal. EOS 'She's dead,' replied Oliver; 'don't you say anything about her to me!' EOS 'What did she die of, Work'us?' EOS _Your_ mother, too! EOS 'And it's a great deal better, Work'us, that she died when she did, or else she'd have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn't it?' EOS missis! EOS Here's the new boy a murdering of me! EOS Help! EOS help! EOS 'Oh, you little wretch!' EOS screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training. EOS said Charlotte. EOS Make haste!' EOS 'Ah! EOS He was all but killed, ma'am, when I come in.' EOS said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the charity-boy. EOS Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable. EOS 'Or the millingtary,' suggested Mr. Claypole. EOS 'No, no,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver's old friend. EOS 'Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! EOS Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye. EOS 'Mr. EOS 'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!' EOS 'No, sir, no. EOS what dreadful pain it is! EOS And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture. EOS 'I knew it! EOS I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!' EOS 'He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,' said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness. EOS 'And his missis,' interposed Mr. Claypole. EOS inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. EOS 'Do you know this here voice, Oliver?' EOS replied Oliver, boldly. EOS An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. EOS 'Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,' said Mrs. Sowerberry. EOS 'It's not Madness, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation. EOS He comes of a bad family. EOS said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear. EOS 'Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?' EOS 'She didn't' said Oliver. EOS He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive. EOS Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad. EOS It was a cold, dark night. EOS He softly reclosed the door. EOS Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning. EOS One timid look around--one moment's pause of hesitation--he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street. EOS He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. EOS Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. EOS Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate. EOS 'Is any one up?' EOS 'I am very glad to see you, dear; but don't stop, don't stop!' EOS 'I hope so,' replied the child. EOS CHAPTER VIII  OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. EOS HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN  Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road. EOS London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever find him there! EOS As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there. EOS He had a penny too--a gift of Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well--in his pocket. EOS When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning. EOS Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along. EOS In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. EOS If he begged at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle--which brought Oliver's heart into his mouth,--very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together. EOS In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother's; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king's highway. EOS But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver's soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone. EOS The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step. EOS Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,  'Hullo, my covey! EOS He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them. EOS said this strange young gentleman to Oliver. EOS said the young gentleman. EOS But,' he added, noticing Oliver's look of surprise, 'I suppose you don't know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.' EOS exclaimed the young gentleman. EOS Now then! EOS Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler's shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, 'a fourpenny bran!' EOS Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention. EOS 'Going to London?' EOS said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded. EOS 'No.' EOS inquired Oliver. EOS 'I have not slept under a roof since I left the country.' EOS Mr. Dawkin's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron's interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of 'The Artful Dodger,' Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him. EOS Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance. EOS Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or harmless errands. EOS His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them. EOS 'A new pal,' replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward. EOS Is Fagin upstairs?' EOS Up with you!' EOS He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him. EOS The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt. EOS Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. EOS These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. EOS 'This is him, Fagin,' said Jack Dawkins;'my friend Oliver Twist.' EOS 'We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,' said the Jew. EOS Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep. EOS CHAPTER IX  CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS  It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. EOS And why should they? EOS Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand. EOS As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed. EOS said the Jew. EOS 'I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,' replied Oliver, meekly. EOS 'You were not awake an hour ago?' EOS 'Upon my word I was not, sir,' replied Oliver, earnestly. EOS 'Of course I know that, my dear. EOS 'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS Bring it here; and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.' EOS When he turned his head, the box was gone. EOS He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates. EOS said the Jew. EOS 'A couple of pocket-books,' replied that young gentlman. EOS At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed. EOS 'Wipes,' replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs. EOS 'Well,' said the Jew, inspecting them closely; 'they're very good ones, very. EOS Shall us, Oliver, eh? EOS Ha! EOS said the Jew. EOS 'He is so jolly green!' EOS This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious. EOS Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed. EOS 'That's a pleasant life, isn't it? EOS They have gone out for the day.' EOS 'Yes,' said the Jew; 'that is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it. EOS 'Yes, sir,' said Oliver. EOS 'See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.' EOS Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other. EOS 'Is it gone?' EOS If you go on, in this way, you'll be the greatest man of the time. EOS Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man. EOS Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's character. EOS At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought. EOS There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. EOS 'Do you see that old cove at the book-stall?' EOS 'He'll do,' said the Dodger. EOS He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study. EOS What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief! EOS Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him. EOS Ay, stop him for God's sake, were it only in mercy! EOS Stopped at last! EOS he don't deserve it.' EOS 'Yes.' EOS Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,' said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. EOS Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?' EOS 'His worship will be disengaged in half a minute. EOS Now, young gallows!' EOS 'There is something in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; 'something that touches and interests me. EOS There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven. EOS He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office. EOS Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene. EOS said Mr. Fang. EOS The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card. EOS said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, 'what's this fellow charged with?' EOS 'Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed--'  'Hold your tongue, sir!' EOS 'I will not, sir!' EOS 'What!' EOS exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening. EOS 'Swear this person!' EOS Here, swear this policeman. EOS With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case;  observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow. EOS 'Come, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do. EOS This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar. EOS inquired Mr. Fang. EOS 'He says they died in his infancy, your worship,' replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply. EOS 'I know better,' said Mr. Fang. EOS 'I knew he was shamming,' said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. EOS 'Summarily,' replied Mr. Fang. EOS The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench. EOS 'Stop, stop! EOS Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty's subjects, expecially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press. EOS [Footnote:  Or were virtually, then.] EOS I demand to be sworn. EOS 'Swear the man,' growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. EOS 'Now, man, what have you got to say?' EOS 'Everybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. EOS 'The very book he has in his hand.' EOS 'Oh, that book, eh?' EOS 'Is it paid for?' EOS said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane. EOS The boy is discharged. EOS cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, 'd--n me! EOS said the magistrate. EOS Directly!' EOS A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other. EOS 'May I accompany you?' EOS I have this unhappy book still! EOS Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds. EOS The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. EOS The curtain at the bed's head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle-work. EOS 'Save us!' EOS Pretty creetur! EOS 'I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy. EOS So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said. EOS said the gentleman. EOS 'Yes, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver. EOS 'No, I know you're not. EOS The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. EOS The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away:  his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs. EOS Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from. EOS It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy. EOS The crisis of the disease was safely past. EOS Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently. EOS And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth:  strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation. EOS What a beautiful, mild face that lady's is!' EOS 'Ah!' EOS A deal,' said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness. EOS 'Why, really, my dear, I don't know,' answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner. EOS 'Why, sure you're not afraid of it?' EOS It makes my heart beat,' added Oliver in a low voice, 'as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn't.' EOS 'Lord save us!' EOS Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions. EOS said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. EOS 'I hope not, sir,' said Mrs. Bedwin. EOS 'And very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.' EOS Any slops, eh?' EOS 'My name is Oliver, sir,' replied the little invalid:  with a look of great astonishment. EOS Oliver White, eh?' EOS 'I never told him so, sir,' returned Oliver in amazement. EOS If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut. EOS Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves. EOS 'Hold your noise,' remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. EOS As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before. EOS inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question. EOS said the Dodger. EOS 'Why, what should he say?' EOS The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court. EOS Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance. EOS The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them. EOS CHAPTER XIII  SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY  'Where's Oliver?' EOS The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other. EOS 'What's become of the boy?' EOS Wot's it all about, Fagin? EOS D--me, if my neck-handkercher an't lined with beer! EOS Come in!' EOS He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck:  with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke. EOS 'Come in, d'ye hear?' EOS growled this engaging ruffian. EOS A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room. EOS He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment. EOS 'I wonder they don't murder you! EOS 'None of your mistering,' replied the ruffian; 'you always mean mischief when you come that. EOS 'And mind you don't poison it,' said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the table. EOS How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess. EOS 'The very thing!' EOS The Jew's countenance fell. EOS 'Why, you're just the very person for it,' reasoned Mr. Sikes: 'nobody about here knows anything of you.' EOS 'No, she won't, Fagin,' said Nancy. EOS By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission. EOS Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand. EOS Oh, do have pity, and tell me what's been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!' EOS Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers:  Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared. EOS 'No,' replied the voice; 'God forbid.' EOS 'Why, the gentleman's got him,' replied the officer. EOS In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew. EOS Don't stop here a minute. EOS he cried in a shrill tone. EOS cried the Jew impatiently. EOS 'If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.' EOS I quite loved it.' EOS 'Well, well!' EOS As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them. EOS just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea. EOS After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach:  and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed. EOS Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself. EOS As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. EOS They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before. EOS 'Dear heart alive! EOS Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say:  looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn't think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better. EOS 'I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,' said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding. EOS wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?' EOS We won't make an author of you, while there's an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.' EOS 'Thank you, sir,' said Oliver. EOS exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's commencement! EOS Don't send me back to the wretched place I came from. EOS Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you. EOS Oliver's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig. EOS 'Is he coming up?' EOS 'He asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.' EOS Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know. EOS 'No,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'I would rather you remained here.' EOS He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot. EOS In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice. EOS Stop--' continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; 'that's the boy who had the orange! EOS 'No, no, he has not had one,' said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. EOS 'Come! EOS If he is not--'  Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words. EOS said Mr. Grimwig. EOS I don't know. EOS I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. EOS I know him! EOS Who is he? EOS He had had a fever six times; he wasn't recommended to mercy on that account. EOS All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman:  knowing his friend's peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman's presence. EOS Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, my dear.' EOS He is deceiving you, my good friend.' EOS 'I'll swear he is not,' replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly. EOS said Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table. EOS 'And I for his falsehood with my head!' EOS 'We shall see,' said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger. EOS 'We will,' replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  'we will.' EOS As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room. EOS 'Call after him,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'it's particular. EOS 'Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,' said Oliver. EOS 'I'll run all the way, sir.' EOS Fetch them down.' EOS 'Bless his sweet face!' EOS said the old lady, looking after him. EOS you really expect him to come back, do you?' EOS inquired Mr. Grimwig. EOS If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I'll eat my head.' EOS Keep quiet!' EOS said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence. EOS Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously. EOS said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket. EOS You hear nothing, you don't,' retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer. EOS 'Well, well, my dear,' said the Jew, 'I know all that; we--we--have a mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.' EOS 'Humph,' said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew's side than on his. EOS All safe!' EOS As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. EOS Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained. EOS inquired Sikes. EOS 'All,' replied the Jew. EOS inquired Sikes, suspiciously. EOS Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. EOS Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him. EOS inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground. EOS 'Nancy!' EOS 'Send her here,' said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. EOS 'You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?' EOS The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry. EOS When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm. EOS And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck. EOS What are you stopping me for?' EOS said the young woman, 'I have found him! EOS Oh! EOS Come home, dear, come. EOS With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher's boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn't think he had better run for the doctor. EOS Come home directly, you cruel boy! EOS Come!' EOS cried the young woman. EOS 'Why, it's Nancy!' EOS said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels; 'young Oliver! EOS Help! EOS help!' EOS 'Help!' EOS Give 'em here.' EOS cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. EOS 'It'll do him good!' EOS rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. EOS Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do! EOS *      *      *      *      *  The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them. EOS 'Do you hear?' EOS He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers. EOS said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. EOS I'd walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn't a shawl to cover me.' EOS The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away. EOS A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. EOS 'Yes,' replied the voice, 'and precious down in the mouth he has been. EOS oh, cry, here he is! EOS Fagin, do look at him! EOS I can't bear it; it is such a jolly game, I cant' bear it. EOS We'd have got something warm for supper.' EOS inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note. EOS 'That's mine, Fagin.' EOS Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you? EOS Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!' EOS 'You're right, Oliver, you're right; they WILL think you have stolen 'em. EOS cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. EOS The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them. EOS said Fagin, looking round. EOS What do you think of that?' EOS Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present. EOS 'We'll cure you of that, my young master.' EOS Ha! EOS 'Am I!' EOS There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke. EOS 'Oh, yes, I know all about it,' replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference. EOS 'You're a nice one,' added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, 'to take up the humane and gen--teel side! EOS A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!' EOS 'Come, come, Sikes,' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; 'we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.' EOS Yes, you deserve 'em from me. EOS Don't you know it?' EOS 'Aye, it is!' EOS 'I shall do you a mischief!' EOS interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; 'a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!' EOS 'Certainly not,' replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question. EOS The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. EOS The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. EOS As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author's skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. EOS He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power. EOS He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care. EOS 'Drat that beadle!' EOS 'Mrs. EOS said the beadle. EOS There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them. EOS 'That's when they're ill, Mrs. Mann,' said the beadle. EOS ha! EOS Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote. EOS said Mrs. Mann with emotion, 'they're as well as can be, the dears! EOS The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man. EOS Why, you little wretch--'  'Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!' EOS 'I should like,' faltered the child, 'if somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.' EOS exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as he was to such things. EOS 'I should like,' said the child, 'to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him. EOS And I should like to tell him,' said the child pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, 'that I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.' EOS said Mr. Bumble imperiously. EOS 'This must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann. EOS 'There; take him away, I can't bear the sight on him.' EOS Putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper. EOS Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted. EOS 'Come in, come in,' said the old lady: 'I knew we should hear of him. EOS Poor dear! EOS inquired Mr. Grimwig. EOS 'Of course,' observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, 'I knew he was. EOS inquired the old gentleman. EOS 'You don't happen to know any good of him, do you?' EOS said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features. EOS Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity. EOS said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'This is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.' EOS It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history. EOS Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further. EOS 'Mrs. EOS Why didn't you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn't had a fever, I suppose, eh? EOS He was interesting, wasn't he? EOS Interesting! EOS And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish. EOS This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. EOS As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Never let me hear the boy's name again. EOS I rang to tell you that. EOS I am in earnest.' EOS Oliver's heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright. EOS As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew's searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman. EOS And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. EOS Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal. EOS So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as 'japanning his trotter-cases.' EOS said the Dodger mournfully. EOS 'I think I know that,' replied Oliver, looking up. EOS inquired Oliver, checking himself. EOS 'I am,' replied the Dodger. EOS 'I am,' repeated the Dodger. EOS 'So's Charley. EOS So's Nancy. EOS 'Won't he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! EOS This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal's abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes' dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance. EOS 'Well, well,' said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings. EOS added the Dodger, with a grin. EOS 'And Fagin would RATHER not!' EOS Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning. EOS 'Why, where's your spirit?' EOS Don't you take any pride out of yourself? EOS 'Oh, blow that!' EOS Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver's flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long. EOS 'Look how he stares, Jack! EOS Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own:  which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin's favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it. EOS 'To be sure, to be sure!' EOS Ha! EOS 'Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?' EOS inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table. EOS He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could. EOS The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. EOS It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. EOS 'Lie down, you stupid brute! EOS 'Well, my dear,' replied the Jew.--'Ah! EOS All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's behaviour. EOS She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a cold night, and no mistake. EOS Burn my body, make haste! EOS Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off. EOS You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?' EOS The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. EOS 'Yes. EOS inquired Sikes. EOS 'Let 'em hear!' EOS When is it to be done? EOS 'And yet,' said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, 'it's a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.' EOS A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal. EOS 'Fagin,' said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; 'is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it's safely done from the outside?' EOS inquired Sikes. EOS 'Yes, my dear, yes,' rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened. EOS 'Then,' said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain, 'let it come off as soon as you like. EOS 'Which is that, Bill?' EOS The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room. EOS 'I tell you I do!' EOS 'You've known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil's in it. EOS inquired Sikes. EOS He mayn't be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you want, if he's only to open a door for you. EOS 'I know he is,' rejoined Fagin. EOS If there's anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound. EOS Mark my words!' EOS Ours for his life. EOS 'And wot,' said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, 'wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose from?' EOS Their looks convict 'em when they get into trouble, and I lose 'em all. EOS Besides,' said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, 'he has us now if he could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us. EOS 'Good-night.' EOS She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be. EOS 'Always the way!' EOS muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward. EOS 'The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts. EOS Ha! EOS The man against the child, for a bag of gold!' EOS 'Is Oliver a-bed? EOS I want to speak to him,' was his first remark as they descended the stairs. EOS To-morrow.' EOS At first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night. EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS Oh no, no!' EOS 'Wait till Bill tells you, then.' EOS The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin's looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then. EOS The more he thought of the Jew's admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning. EOS Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony. EOS The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead. EOS Only me,' replied a tremulous voice. EOS The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him:  and wrung her hands; but made no reply. EOS 'Has anything happened?' EOS I will, indeed.' EOS She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath. EOS The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold. EOS 'I don't know what comes over me sometimes,' said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; 'it's this damp dirty room, I think. EOS asked Oliver. EOS But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o'clock; and that many people were still in the streets:  of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale. EOS 'Hush!' EOS said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round. EOS If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power. EOS For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. EOS Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially. EOS 'He'd have been in the way.' EOS 'Like a lamb,' rejoined Nancy. EOS 'Now, first:  do you know wot this is?' EOS 'Well, then, look here,' continued Sikes. EOS 'Now it's loaded,' said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished. EOS When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung over the back of a chair. EOS It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside. EOS A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy. EOS 'Now, then!' EOS Look sharp, or you'll get no breakfast; for it's late as it is.' EOS Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders. EOS Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away. EOS But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it. EOS As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle. EOS said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew's Church, 'hard upon seven! EOS Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey. EOS Don't mind him.' EOS And he drove away. EOS Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, 'Hampton.' EOS They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company. EOS It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. EOS inquired Sikes. EOS Here's luck to him. EOS 'If you're going directly, I can,' replied the man, looking out of the pot. EOS 'Are you going to Halliford?' EOS 'Going on to Shepperton,' replied Sikes. EOS rejoined Sikes. EOS Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two 'to bear him up,' and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also. EOS Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it:  tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly. EOS They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance. EOS Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch. EOS 'Don't make such a row,' said Sikes, bolting the door. EOS The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers:  for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake. EOS 'There's Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. EOS Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?' EOS said this figure, turning his head towards the door, 'I'm glad to see you. EOS 'Wud of Bister Fagid's lads,' exclaimed Barney, with a grin. EOS 'Indeed,' said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man's face; 'indeed, I--'  'Down with it!' EOS said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. EOS Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes. EOS This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. EOS They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. EOS Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets. EOS 'Here they are,' replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. EOS 'You loaded them yourself.' EOS 'I've got 'em,' replied Sikes. EOS 'Bring them bits of timber, Barney. EOS That's the time of day.' EOS 'Now then!' EOS Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again. EOS 'Slap through the town,' whispered Sikes; 'there'll be nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.' EOS cried Oliver; 'let me run away and die in the fields. EOS 'Hush!' EOS Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open. EOS 'Now listen, you young limb,' whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver's face; 'I'm a going to put you through there. EOS They listened intently. EOS In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. EOS Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly. EOS Ah!' EOS How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! EOS Except,' said Mrs. Corney, pausing, 'except to a poor desolate creature like me. EOS 'I shall never get another!' EOS said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; 'I shall never get another--like him.' EOS 'Shall I shut the door, ma'am?' EOS 'Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron. EOS 'Anti-porochial weather this, ma'am. EOS 'When, indeed, ma'am!' EOS Is he grateful, ma'am? EOS What does he do, ma'am, but ask for a few coals; if it's only a pocket handkerchief full, he says! EOS The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on. EOS "Very good," says our overseer, taking 'em away again, "you won't get anything else here." EOS "Oh no, you won't," says our overseer.' EOS 'Well, ma'am,' rejoined the beadle, 'he went away; and he _did_ die in the streets. EOS exclaimed Mrs. Corney. EOS Betwixt you and me, ma'am,' returned Mr. Bumble, 'that's the great principle; and that's the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you'll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. EOS The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether--whether he wouldn't take a cup of tea? EOS She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot. EOS Again Mr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he had coughed yet. EOS The tea was made, and handed in silence. EOS 'Then you're a cruel man,' said the matron vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the beadle's cup; 'and a very hard-hearted man besides.' EOS Corney?' EOS The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron. EOS 'If you please, mistress,' said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly:  putting her head in at the door, 'Old Sally is a-going fast.' EOS But she's troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,--and that's not often, for she is dying very hard,--she says she has got something to tell, which you must hear. EOS Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way. EOS He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table. EOS Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture. EOS Alas! EOS 'Oh!' EOS asked the matron. EOS Is she dozing, old lady?' EOS The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative. EOS 'Put the light on the floor. EOS demanded the first. EOS 'I mind the time,' said the first speaker, 'when she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.' EOS 'We have none of us long to wait for Death. EOS said the matron sternly. EOS 'Often,' answered the first woman. EOS It's no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I won't--that's more. EOS If you make a fool of me again, I'll soon cure you, I warrant you!' EOS 'Who's that?' EOS 'Hush, hush!' EOS 'Lie down, lie down!' EOS 'I'll never lie down again alive!' EOS Come here! EOS 'Turn them away,' said the woman, drowsily; 'make haste! EOS On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves. EOS She gave birth to a boy, and died. EOS 'Ay,' murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state, 'what about her?--what about--I know!' EOS cried the matron, with a gesture as if she would call for help. EOS Who was the mother? EOS When was it?' EOS 'Known what?' EOS Such a gentle lamb! EOS said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened. EOS At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. EOS It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. EOS 'I never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. EOS Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter. EOS Tommy Chitling hasn't won a point; and I went partners with him against the Artfull and dumb.' EOS said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason. EOS That 'ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there's no standing again' him.' EOS 'Ha! EOS Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a shilling at a time. EOS '_I_ should say,' replied Master Bates, with a grin, 'that he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy. EOS what a spree!' EOS Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh. EOS But it turned out a good job for you; didn't it, Fagin! EOS It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don't want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?' EOS 'There, now. EOS 'To be sure it would, my dear,' replied the Jew. EOS Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs. EOS Quiet, Charley! EOS said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. EOS Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking. EOS 'Yes, yes!' EOS 'Why, you don't mean to say--' began Toby, turning pale. EOS cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. EOS 'Where are they? EOS Where are they? EOS Damme! EOS We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. EOS CHAPTER XXVI  IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED  The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit's intelligence. EOS Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely. EOS Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill. EOS In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets. EOS 'Let me see,' pursued the merchant, reflecting. EOS '_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,' replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. EOS Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person. EOS As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could. EOS It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group. EOS Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it. EOS Fagin?' EOS inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing. EOS Depend on it, they're on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he'd blow upon the thing at once. EOS I'll pound it, that Barney's managing properly. EOS Let him alone for that.' EOS 'Will _he_ be here to-night?' EOS 'Hush!' EOS 'Good!' EOS 'Nothing more?' EOS During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned. EOS Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!' EOS 'I shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. EOS I can't bear to have him about me. EOS 'Pooh!' EOS 'It's no fault of yours, if I am not! EOS 'It does not.' EOS 'Change it!' EOS And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to--'  Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour. EOS A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. EOS He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her. EOS 'Don't worry me now, Fagin!' EOS And if Toby got clear off, Bill's pretty sure to be safe; for Bill's worth two of Toby any time.' EOS Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed. EOS Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew's female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked. EOS and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed. EOS Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table. EOS The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home. EOS 'Fagin!' EOS 'Ah!' EOS interrupted the stranger. EOS The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived:  remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover:  for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him. EOS Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light. EOS 'It's as dark as the grave,' said the man, groping forward a few steps. EOS 'We can say the few words we've got to say in here, my dear,' said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; 'and as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we'll set the candle on the stairs. EOS With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. EOS If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn't you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?' EOS inquired the Jew humbly. EOS 'Curse him, no!' EOS 'His hand was not in. EOS renewed the Jew. EOS I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then _she_ begins to favour him.' EOS If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? EOS cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet. EOS 'Yonder! EOS 'I'll swear I saw it!' EOS said the Jew, when they had regained the passage. EOS Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, 'I'll do it!' EOS He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest. EOS Bumble!' EOS 'It's dreadful to think of!' EOS 'Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble. EOS 'Then take something, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble soothingly. EOS 'Not for the world!' EOS 'Try it! EOS 'Very much so indeed, ma'am,' said the beadle. EOS Corney?' EOS By the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney's chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney's apron-string, round which it gradually became entwined. EOS 'We are all weak creeturs,' said Mr. Bumble. EOS 'This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble looking round. EOS 'It would be too much for one,' murmured the lady. EOS Corney?' EOS Corney?' EOS 'Such porochial perfection!' EOS 'You know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?' EOS 'Yes,' replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully. EOS 'He can't live a week, the doctor says,' pursued Mr. Bumble. EOS 'He is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up. EOS Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens! EOS Mrs. Corney sobbed. EOS 'Ye--ye--yes!' EOS Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady's spirits. EOS While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman's decease. EOS 'Not now,' rejoined the lady; 'one of these days. EOS Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. EOS Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised. EOS The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. EOS 'What a delicious thing is a oyster!' EOS 'What a pity it is, a number of 'em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn't it, Charlotte?' EOS 'So it is,' acquiesced Mr. Claypole. EOS said Noah, reflectively; 'how queer!' EOS Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning. EOS As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers. EOS There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction. EOS The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. EOS 'Bear a hand with the boy,' cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate. EOS 'Come back!' EOS Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along. EOS 'Quicker!' EOS 'It's all up, Bill!' EOS cried Toby; 'drop the kid, and show 'em your heels.' EOS 'Ho, ho, there!' EOS cried a tremulous voice in the rear. EOS Neptune! EOS Giles ought to know.' EOS 'Certainly,' replied the shorter man; 'and whatever Mr. Giles says, it isn't our place to contradict him. EOS No, no, I know my sitiwation! EOS 'I an't,' said Brittles. EOS 'You're a lie, Brittles,' said Mr. Giles. EOS 'You may depend upon it,' said Giles, 'that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement. EOS This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit. EOS The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth of day--glimmered faintly in the sky. EOS At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke. EOS Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground. EOS But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither. EOS And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind. EOS He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico. EOS 'It was about half-past two,' said Mr. Giles, 'or I wouldn't swear that it mightn't have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.' EOS 'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,' suggested Brittles. EOS 'It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,' rejoined Mr. Giles; 'but, at this time, it had a busting sound. EOS The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated 'Lor!' EOS 'Brittles is right,' said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; 'from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. EOS The women were out of the question. EOS These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker's arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door. EOS bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; 'here's one of the thieves, ma'am! EOS 'Giles!' EOS She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles's room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey:  from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor. EOS 'But won't you take one look at him, first, miss?' EOS 'Poor fellow! EOS treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!' EOS He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance. EOS Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. EOS 'It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,' said the young lady, smiling. EOS With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves. EOS Dear, dear! EOS The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous. EOS Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour. EOS said the doctor. EOS 'Why, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,' replied the doctor; 'though I don't think he is. EOS 'Nor heard anything about him?' EOS Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage. EOS 'Rose wished to see the man,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'but I wouldn't hear of it.' EOS He has not been shaved very recently, but he don't look at all ferocious notwithstanding. EOS Stop, though! EOS His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow. EOS Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver's hair from his face. EOS The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. EOS can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?' EOS 'But even if he has been wicked,' pursued Rose, 'think how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. EOS Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy's sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment. EOS Oh! EOS Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. EOS 'Well,' said the doctor, laughing heartily, 'that is no very difficult matter. EOS But to return to this boy. EOS Now I make this stipulation--that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.' EOS if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day's life brings with it! EOS There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. EOS 'Misses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among 'em here.' EOS 'That's not the point,' said the doctor, mysteriously. EOS 'Mr. EOS 'Then tell me this,' said the doctor, 'both of you, both of you! EOS Out with it! EOS Come! EOS The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction. EOS 'Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?' EOS 'It's a simple question of identity, you will observe,' said the doctor. EOS The constable nodded profoundly. EOS exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn. EOS Then confound your--slow coaches down here; that's all,' said the doctor, walking away. EOS CHAPTER XXXI  INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION  'Who's that?' EOS inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand. EOS This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were. EOS said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table. EOS 'I can't say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,' said Blathers; 'but my opinion at once is,--I don't mind committing myself to that extent,--that this wasn't done by a yokel; eh, Duff?' EOS 'Certainly not,' replied Duff. EOS 'That's it, master,' replied Blathers. EOS 'Who is the boy? EOS 'We had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. EOS This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night's adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. EOS interrupted Rose. EOS Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted. EOS Don't you see all this?' EOS Bless the bright eyes of your sex! EOS what is to be done?' EOS exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. EOS The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. EOS We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. EOS Come in!' EOS We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once, if you please.' EOS Anythink that's handy, miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.' EOS 'Ah!' EOS said Mr. Blathers:  not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; 'I have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.' EOS 'It was the Family Pet, I tell you. EOS 'This here Conkey Chickweed--'  'Conkey means Nosey, ma'am,' interposed Duff. EOS They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about 'em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost 'em. EOS "I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick," says the poor man; "but we're sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again." EOS Stop thief! EOS Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; "Which is the man?" EOS It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn't to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. EOS 'What did Jem Spyers say?' EOS 'Jem Spyers,' resumed the officer, 'for a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business. EOS said Chickweed. EOS 'Very curious, indeed,' observed the doctor. EOS 'Think what, now?' EOS 'Think it's the same boy, Stupid-head?' EOS 'Has this man been a-drinking, sir?' EOS Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient's pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them. EOS Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. EOS If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness. EOS said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; 'you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. EOS cried Oliver. EOS 'Oh! EOS she inquired, watching Oliver's thoughtful face. EOS 'If they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.' EOS In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition. EOS cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. EOS cried the doctor. EOS 'What's the matter here?' EOS 'A good deal. EOS Robbery is the matter.' EOS 'There'll be Murder the matter, too,' replied the hump-backed man, coolly, 'if you don't take your hands off. EOS Do you hear me?' EOS 'I hear you,' said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake. EOS 'Where's--confound the fellow, what's his rascally name--Sikes; that's it. EOS Where's Sikes, you thief?' EOS You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.' EOS With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage. EOS The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards. EOS That!' EOS Oh! EOS I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.' EOS said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. EOS It stopped. EOS The servant did not know; but would go and inquire. EOS No; home again straight!' EOS Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the banker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them. EOS Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved:  may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it. EOS It was a lovely spot to which they repaired. EOS It was a happy time. EOS Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. EOS Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said:  and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it. EOS When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. EOS So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver's were true felicity. EOS With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself. EOS Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people. EOS One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them:  for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing. EOS 'I don't know what it is; I can't describe it; but I feel--'  'Not ill, my love?' EOS The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. EOS 'My child!' EOS Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before. EOS Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale. EOS Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health:  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well. EOS 'I hope,' said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, 'that nothing is the matter? EOS said Oliver. EOS 'Two hours ago, she was quite well.' EOS Oh, what shall I do without her!' EOS 'Oh! EOS 'You think like a child, poor boy. EOS 'Here is another letter,' said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; 'but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know. EOS 'Is it for Chertsey, too, ma'am?' EOS With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster. EOS He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick. EOS cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling. EOS 'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver; 'I was in a great hurry to get home, and didn't see you were coming.' EOS muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes. EOS 'Who would have thought it! EOS The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. EOS He advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and foaming, in a fit. EOS Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious. EOS A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature. EOS How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber! EOS the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! EOS Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. EOS People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears. EOS The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. EOS There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and fragrance. EOS A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young. EOS He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die. EOS I can bear it; anything but suspense! EOS My dear child! EOS She is dying!' EOS The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her. EOS CHAPTER XXXIV  CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER  It was almost too much happiness to bear. EOS Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest. EOS 'Is it you, Giles?' EOS cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door. EOS demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. EOS 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,' said Giles:  giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; 'but if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. EOS As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer. EOS The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides. EOS If Rose had--I cannot utter that word now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself! EOS 'And who can wonder if it be so, mother?' EOS If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.' EOS 'I think, my dear son,' returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, 'that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting. EOS Above all, I think' said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son's face, 'that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him:  he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life. EOS 'I will not,' rejoined Mrs. Maylie; 'but I would have you consider--'  'I _have_ considered!' EOS No! EOS urged the young man. EOS 'She has formed no other attachment?' EOS 'What do you mean?' EOS said the young man, eagerly. EOS You will not refuse to do this, mother?' EOS 'Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?' EOS 'The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone of patronage; 'and sends his respectful duty, sir.' EOS Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. EOS Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. EOS The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. EOS It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood. EOS He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep. EOS It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes:  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness. EOS Come away.' EOS Good Heaven! EOS There--there--at the window--close before him--so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back:  with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his:  there stood the Jew! EOS the Jew!' EOS 'That,' replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; 'I missed them in an instant.' EOS There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen. EOS There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time. EOS 'It must have been a dream, Oliver,' said Harry Maylie. EOS 'Oh no, indeed, sir,' replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch's countenance; 'I saw him too plainly for that. EOS 'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.' EOS 'They took this way?' EOS 'As I am that the men were at the window,' replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow. EOS Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. EOS echoed the doctor. EOS 'Blathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.' EOS Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. EOS On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. EOS 'A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,' said the young man, drawing his chair towards her. EOS 'You should, indeed,' replied Rose. EOS We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! EOS Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide. EOS 'I did not mean that,' said Rose, weeping; 'I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.' EOS 'Rose, my own dear Rose! EOS 'It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?' EOS I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.' EOS I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects. EOS 'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--' Harry began. EOS said Harry. EOS said Harry. EOS 'I could,' said Rose. EOS 'Your reason in your own words. EOS From your own lips, let me hear it!' EOS 'One word more, Rose. EOS Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?' EOS 'Do not press me to reply,' answered Rose. EOS Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her. EOS 'I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,' said Rose, extending her hand. EOS 'Then let it be so,' rejoined Rose; 'it is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.' EOS She extended her hand again. EOS CHAPTER XXXVI  IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES  'And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?' EOS said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast-table. EOS 'You will tell me a different tale one of these days,' said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason. EOS The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed. EOS Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed. EOS Will you?' EOS 'Oh! EOS certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,' exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission. EOS Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! EOS cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; 'something very short of flying will keep pace with _me_. EOS It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed. EOS And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself. EOS Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose's face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy. EOS A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat. EOS Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they? EOS 'And to-morrow two months it was done!' EOS I went very reasonable. EOS said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness. EOS If it fails with her, my power is gone.') EOS 'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble; 'and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.' EOS 'The prerogative of a man is to command.' EOS 'And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?' EOS 'To obey, ma'am,' thundered Mr. Bumble. EOS This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other. EOS 'Get up!' EOS 'Are you going?' EOS You are so very violent, that really I--'  At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. EOS Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field. EOS He had a decided propensity for bullying:  derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward. EOS After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded. EOS Hallo! EOS 'My dear,' said Mr. Bumble, 'I didn't know you were here.' EOS 'Didn't know I was here!' EOS repeated Mrs. Bumble. EOS said Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'What business is it of yours?' EOS What could Mr. Bumble do? EOS Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.' EOS I don't ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is. EOS 'Very good. EOS I've done it.' EOS 'And the time, night.' EOS said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger's excited description. EOS 'A boy was born there.' EOS 'It would be hard to tell. EOS demanded the stranger, sternly. EOS 'That she died last winter,' rejoined Mr. Bumble. EOS But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half. EOS He well remembered the night of old Sally's death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman's attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist. EOS 'How can I find her?' EOS cried the stranger, hastily. EOS It's your interest.' EOS On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name. EOS 'Only to ask a question,' said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper. EOS The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate. EOS 'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron: 'and be careful to say as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.' EOS Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards. EOS The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation. EOS retorted Monks. EOS 'No,' rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke. EOS 'Of course you don't!' EOS 'Hear it!' EOS 'The first question is, of what nature was her communication?' EOS 'Humph!' EOS 'I have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.' EOS Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:  which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure. EOS 'Speak out, and let me know which.' EOS Not before.' EOS 'It's not a large sum, either.' EOS 'You can easily take it away again,' replied the matron. EOS 'Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,' submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: '_I_ am here, my dear. EOS 'So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there's only one will between them. EOS The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. EOS 'She spoke of a young creature,' resumed the matron, 'who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.' EOS 'Ay?' EOS Where? EOS When? EOS demanded Monks. EOS 'In good time I'll tell you.' EOS The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.' EOS The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles. EOS The three looking into each other's faces, seemed to breathe more freely. EOS 'If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it. EOS 'By all means,' observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity. EOS said Monks, with a threatening look. EOS Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water. EOS 'How do you feel to-night, Bill?' EOS said Sikes. EOS 'Come! EOS D'ye hear me?' EOS 'I hear you,' replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh. EOS you've thought better of it, have you?' EOS 'It's nothing,' said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. EOS 'What'll be over?' EOS 'What foolery are you up to, now, again? EOS 'What's the matter here, my dear?' EOS 'Don't stand chattering and grinning at me!' EOS 'Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?' EOS 'No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see. EOS said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. EOS 'I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,' replied the Jew. EOS 'Here! EOS 'Don't be out of temper, my dear,' urged Fagin, submissively. EOS 'I have never forgot you, Bill; never once.' EOS 'He says true enough there!' EOS 'Lots!' EOS The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady's return. EOS Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go. EOS 'Has nobody been, Toby?' EOS 'Not a living leg,' answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; 'it's been as dull as swipes. EOS Horrid dull, I'm blessed if I an't!' EOS With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn't value his losses the snap of his little finger. EOS 'A very clever fellow, my dear,' said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils. EOS 'Very much so, indeed, my dear. EOS Dodger! EOS It's time you were on the lay. EOS Come! EOS It's near ten, and nothing done yet.' EOS Listen!' EOS 'Bah!' EOS It was Monks. EOS 'Don't move, Nancy.' EOS The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person. EOS 'Not that infernal hole we were in before,' she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. EOS exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, 'how pale you are!' EOS 'Pale!' EOS echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him. EOS What have you been doing to yourself?' EOS 'Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don't know how long and all,' replied the girl carelessly. EOS When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way. EOS It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts:  soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker. EOS If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted. EOS It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment. EOS As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment. EOS 'But, Lord! EOS You're not a-going to--. EOS No, damme! EOS The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents. EOS Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. EOS 'I may be too late, even now.' EOS Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of London. EOS 'A lady who is stopping in this house,' answered the girl. EOS 'Nor business?' EOS said the man. EOS said the man, pushing her towards the door. EOS Take yourself off.' EOS 'I shall be carried out if I go!' EOS replied the man. EOS This allusion to Nancy's doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel. EOS 'I say,' said the man, 'you're coming it strong!' EOS Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. EOS Tell me why you wished to see me. EOS Sit down.' EOS 'I am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! EOS Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. EOS 'Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,' cried the girl, 'that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and--and--something worse than all--as I have been from my cradle. EOS 'I pity you!' EOS 'It wrings my heart to hear you!' EOS '--That Monks,' pursued the girl, 'had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn't make out why. EOS The first words I heard Monks say were these:  "So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin." EOS said Rose. EOS I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once. EOS It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. EOS Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors? EOS 'It is,' cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; 'I cannot leave him now! EOS 'Is it possible,' cried Rose, 'that for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? EOS 'What am I to do?' EOS 'Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?' EOS asked Rose. EOS 'Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,' said the girl without hesitation, 'I will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.' EOS 'Think once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it. EOS Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!' EOS 'I wish to serve you indeed.' EOS 'You would serve me best, lady,' replied the girl, wringing her hands, 'if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived. EOS After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry. EOS But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me--he did when he went away. EOS 'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said Rose, soothing him. EOS I didn't speak to him--I couldn't speak to him, for he didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him. EOS Look here,' said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, 'here it is; here's where he lives--I'm going there directly! EOS she said. EOS I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.' EOS At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon. EOS 'Mr. EOS said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken. EOS Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?' EOS Mr. Brownlow inclined his head. EOS 'A bad one! EOS 'Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'he does not mean what he says.' EOS 'Now, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested. EOS Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.' EOS Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend. EOS 'He is waiting in a coach at the door,' replied Rose. EOS he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding. EOS Here they are!' EOS 'People's eyes, at my time of life, don't improve with age, sir.' EOS 'I could have told you that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but put on your glasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will you?' EOS 'My dear old nurse!' EOS 'He would come back--I knew he would,' said the old lady, holding him in her arms. EOS 'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's son he is dressed again! EOS Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. EOS Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. EOS To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred. EOS Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath. EOS And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose. EOS 'Not exactly that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; 'but we must proceed gently and with great care.' EOS 'Gentleness and care,' exclaimed the doctor. EOS 'But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.' EOS 'What object?' EOS 'You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; 'placing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?' EOS 'Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,' suggested the doctor, 'and transporting the rest.' EOS He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. EOS I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.' EOS rejoined Mr. Brownlow. EOS What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.' EOS What are yer talking about? EOS 'Is it much farther?' EOS 'Look there! EOS Those are the lights of London.' EOS 'Never mind whether they're two mile off, or twenty,' said Noah Claypole; for he it was; 'but get up and come on, or I'll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.' EOS she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards. EOS 'A pretty thing it would be, wouldn't it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,' said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. EOS 'No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,' said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his. EOS Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose. EOS Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment. EOS repeated the old man in a whisper. EOS 'Aha!' EOS he whispered, looking round to Barney, 'I like that fellow's looks. EOS exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face. EOS After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed. EOS 'We have not so much dust as that in London,' replied Fagin, pointing from Noah's shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles. EOS ha! EOS It was very lucky it was only me.' EOS 'I didn't take it,' stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair; 'it was all her doing; yer've got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.' EOS 'In what way?' EOS And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I've said the word, and you may make your minds easy.' EOS 'She'll take the luggage upstairs the while. EOS 'Not a countryman among 'em; and I don't think he'd take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn't run rather short of assistants just now,' replied Fagin. EOS said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket. EOS 'Number and date taken, I suppose? EOS It's not worth much to him. EOS 'When could I see him?' EOS asked Noah doubtfully. EOS suggested Fagin. EOS 'I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,' said Fagin. EOS observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate. EOS asked Fagin. EOS 'Don't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?' EOS Ha! EOS ha! EOS 'Mr. EOS 'Mrs. EOS Bolter's humble servant,' said Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness. EOS 'I hope I shall know her better very shortly.' EOS 'Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?' EOS replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand. EOS 'She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,' said Mr. Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. EOS 'Some people are nobody's enemies but their own, yer know.' EOS Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven. EOS It's neither, my friend, neither. EOS It's number one. EOS ha!' EOS cried Mr. Bolter. EOS You can't take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.' EOS To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.' EOS To keep my little business all snug, I depend upon you. EOS The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first--that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.' EOS yer a cunning old codger!' EOS Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. EOS To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter's respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken. EOS 'It's this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,' said Fagin. EOS 'No,' replied Fagin, 'not very. EOS They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. EOS he was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many to have him back. EOS You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.' EOS 'I'm doubtful about it,' replied Fagin, with a sigh. EOS 'They've found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more's a coming to 'dentify him; and the Artful's booked for a passage out,' replied Master Bates. EOS 'I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. EOS To think of Jack Dawkins--lummy Jack--the Dodger--the Artful Dodger--going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! EOS Oh, why didn't he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!' EOS 'What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!' EOS 'Ha! EOS 'Well, it is a honour that is!' EOS cried Charley Bates. EOS 'Would!' EOS 'Ah, to be sure, so he will,' repeated Charley, rubbing his hands. EOS ha! EOS What a regular game! EOS interposed Charley. EOS It's not in my department, that ain't.' EOS 'Never mind,' retorted Mr. Bolter; 'and don't yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer'll find yerself in the wrong shop.' EOS Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. EOS These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street. EOS At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate 'the names of them two files as was on the bench.' EOS cried the jailer. EOS 'He ought to have been, a many times,' replied the jailer. EOS cried the Artful, making a note of the statement. EOS I should like to see 'em.' EOS 'I beg your pardon,' said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction. EOS 'Ah! EOS Here, carry me off to prison! EOS With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer's face, with great glee and self-approval. EOS SHE FAILS. EOS She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. EOS At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards--she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions. EOS It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. EOS Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. EOS 'Dark and heavy it is too. EOS 'Ah!' EOS 'You're right for once,' replied Sikes gruffly. EOS 'We must make up for lost time when we've got things into a good train. EOS 'That's the way to talk, my dear,' replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder. EOS 'Well, so be it.' EOS 'You're like yourself to-night, Bill. EOS said Fagin, determined not to be offended. EOS 'Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,' returned Sikes. EOS 'Hallo!' EOS retorted Sikes. EOS 'Nowhere. EOS I told you that before,' rejoined the girl. EOS 'I want a breath of air.' EOS With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press. EOS 'You'll drive me on the something desperate,' muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak. EOS 'Tell him to let me go, Fagin. EOS 'Let me go,' said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, 'Bill, let me go; you don't know what you are doing. EOS For only one hour--do--do!' EOS She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further. EOS With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin. EOS said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face. EOS 'You may say that, Bill,' replied Fagin thoughtfully. EOS 'I thought I had tamed her, but she's as bad as ever.' EOS 'Nor I,' said Sikes. EOS 'I think she's got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won't come out--eh?' EOS Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. EOS 'What is it, Nancy, dear?' EOS 'If _he_'--he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs--'is so hard with you (he's a brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don't you--'  'Well?' EOS You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend. EOS I have the means at hand, quiet and close. EOS If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog--like a dog! EOS She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them. EOS He had conceived the idea--not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees--that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend. EOS The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons. EOS There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. EOS The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the object of her more recent fancy. EOS 'I can,' said Fagin, almost aloud. EOS Don't yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. EOS 'Where's Charlotte?' EOS There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business. EOS 'Beautiful! EOS 'I want you, Bolter,' said Fagin, leaning over the table, 'to do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.' EOS 'I say,' rejoined Bolter, 'don't yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o' yer police-offices. EOS 'That's not the smallest danger in it--not the very smallest,' said the Jew; 'it's only to dodge a woman.' EOS asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face. EOS inquired Noah. EOS cried Noah, curling up his nose. EOS ha! EOS 'Of course, of course,' replied Noah. EOS Where am I to wait for her? EOS 'All that, my dear, you shall hear from me. EOS I'll point her out at the proper time,' said Fagin. EOS 'You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.' EOS That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter's dress:  ready to turn out at a word from Fagin. EOS Six nights passed--six long weary nights--and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. EOS They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London. EOS 'Is that the woman?' EOS 'I can't see her face well,' whispered Noah. EOS 'I should know her among a thousand.' EOS Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered. EOS 'Dow.' EOS He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl's retreating figure, already at some distance before him. EOS She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step. EOS It was a very dark night. EOS Come away--out of the public road--down the steps yonder!' EOS The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour's Church, form a landing-stairs from the river. EOS He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear. EOS He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively. EOS I don't know why it is,' said the girl, shuddering, 'but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.' EOS 'A fear of what?' EOS 'I scarcely know of what,' replied the girl. EOS I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.' EOS 'Imagination,' said the gentleman, soothing her. EOS 'Speak to her kindly,' said the young lady to her companion. EOS said the gentleman. EOS 'A Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven. EOS 'Him that I told the young lady of before.' EOS 'Did he awake before you returned?' EOS 'I am ready,' replied the girl, as he paused for a moment. EOS 'That man must be delivered up by you,' said the gentleman. EOS 'You will not?' EOS 'Then,' said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain; 'put Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.' EOS suggested the girl. EOS 'You have,' replied Rose. EOS 'Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?' EOS 'The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.' EOS His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can't be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. EOS The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed. EOS 'Upon his throat:  so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face:  there is--'  'A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?' EOS said the girl. EOS 'I think I do,' said the gentleman, breaking silence. EOS Many people are singularly like each other. EOS 'Think now. EOS I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. EOS 'She will be persuaded now,' cried the young lady. EOS I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it. EOS I must have gone too far to turn back,--and yet I don't know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off. EOS 'To such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life. EOS Let us part. EOS If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.' EOS How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. EOS Let me have that to think of. EOS There. EOS God bless you. EOS The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested. EOS They stopped at the summit of the stairs. EOS Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the Jew's house as fast as his legs would carry him. EOS 'At last!' EOS He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm. EOS 'He's gone mad. EOS said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. EOS Which one that is, don't matter.' EOS 'Tell away! EOS 'Suppose that lad,' pursued Fagin, 'was to peach--to blow upon us all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken. EOS 'Suppose he did all this, what then?' EOS replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. EOS 'If he was left alive till I came, I'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.' EOS 'Try me.' EOS Poor lad!' EOS 'You followed her?' EOS 'They asked her,' said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, 'they asked her why she didn't come, last Sunday, as she promised. EOS She said she couldn't.' EOS 'What more of him?' EOS cried Fagin, following him hastily. EOS The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door:  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up. EOS 'Let me out,' said Sikes. EOS Let me out, I say!' EOS The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other's faces. EOS 'I mean,' said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, 'not too violent for safety. EOS 'It is you, Bill!' EOS said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return. EOS 'Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me. EOS Oh! EOS You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. EOS 'Bill,' cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, 'the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. EOS He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. EOS If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light! EOS Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. EOS Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door:  dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. EOS He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house. EOS He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside. EOS There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. EOS _He_ knew that. EOS The glance was instantaneous. EOS He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away. EOS He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. EOS Hendon. EOS They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog:  to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time. EOS There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. EOS asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner. EOS Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. EOS If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she's cured at once--for it's poison. EOS 'There are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can't make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins. EOS One penny a square! EOS 'Give that back.' EOS 'I'll take it clean out, sir,' replied the man, winking to the company, 'before you can come across the room to get it. EOS Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain--'  The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house. EOS The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. EOS A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement. EOS 'Oh, that's quite true,' said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window. EOS 'Man or woman, pray, sir?' EOS 'Damn that 'ere bag,' said the guard; 'are you gone to sleep in there?' EOS He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. EOS He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture. EOS The broad sky seemed on fire. EOS Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood. EOS mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food. EOS He came upon the spot. EOS 'A good hiding-place, too. EOS 'Do you hear me call? EOS cried Sikes. EOS 'Come back!' EOS The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed. EOS The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions. EOS 'How dare you say this of me?' EOS There, sir. EOS Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. EOS 'You will decide quickly,' said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure. EOS 'This is pretty treatment, sir,' said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, 'from my father's oldest friend.' EOS 'It is because I was your father's oldest friend, young man,' returned Mr. Brownlow; 'it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man:  it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters's death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven willed otherwise--have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.' EOS 'What is the name to me?' EOS I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.' EOS 'You know I was an only child. EOS I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. EOS Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. EOS But it rusted and cankered at your father's heart for years.' EOS Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?' EOS 'These new friends, then,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'were a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before, and left him with two children--there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived. EOS He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will--_no will_--so that the whole property fell to her and you.' EOS At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker. EOS 'Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,' said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other's face, 'he came to me.' EOS cried Monks. EOS 'Because you know it well.' EOS 'I shall show you that I know more than that.' EOS Your agents had no clue to your residence. EOS There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death. EOS Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue. EOS Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.' EOS 'It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'Make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love. EOS While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:  torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other:  the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation. EOS 'He will be taken to-night!' EOS 'The murderer?' EOS 'I will give fifty more,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. EOS As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,' replied the doctor, 'and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.' EOS 'You--you--will be secret with me?' EOS Remain here till I return. EOS asked the doctor in a whisper. EOS We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest:  especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now. EOS CHAPTER L  THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE  Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants. EOS To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion. EOS Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect. EOS At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him. EOS One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion. EOS 'Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,' added Mr. Kags. EOS 'He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he'll be here soon,' replied Chitling. EOS 'What's the meaning of this?' EOS 'He can't be coming here. EOS 'If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog,' said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. EOS 'Where can he have come from!' EOS What do you think?' EOS 'If he had,' said Kags, 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he did it. EOS They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound. EOS There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. EOS asked the other man in a hoarse voice. EOS 'None. EOS Not a word had been exchanged. EOS He looked from one to another in silence. EOS 'True.' EOS There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke. EOS 'You that keep this house,' said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, 'do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?' EOS 'Witness you three,' cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke. EOS Help! EOS There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps--endless they seemed in number--crossing the nearest wooden bridge. EOS He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. EOS Some called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind:  and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar. EOS Give me a rope, a long rope. EOS Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it. EOS He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop. EOS Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains. EOS cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; 'that's the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back! EOS 'You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,' said Oliver. EOS At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room. EOS He was born in this town.' EOS He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke. EOS You!' EOS 'The letter?--A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. EOS 'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast. EOS 'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, 'was in the same spirit as the letter. EOS The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions--one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age. EOS She burnt this will. EOS Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. EOS As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared:  of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued:  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him. EOS 'Do my hi's deceive me!' EOS Bumble?' EOS remonstrated the workhouse master. EOS 'How do you do, sir? EOS I hope you are very well.' EOS 'Perhaps _you_ don't?' EOS 'Nor sold him anything, perhaps?' EOS 'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble. EOS 'Yes,' added the second, 'and it was a "locket and gold ring." EOS We were by. EOS Oh! EOS 'No,' replied the woman; 'if he'--she pointed to Monks--'has been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. EOS What then?' EOS 'I hope,' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: 'I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?' EOS 'Indeed it will,' replied Mr. Brownlow. EOS 'You may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.' EOS She _would_ do it,' urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room. EOS You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.' EOS 'What was the fate of the other--the child?' EOS 'No. EOS 'Come, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! EOS 'Not aunt,' cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; 'I'll never call her aunt--sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! EOS Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. EOS A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment. EOS 'Stay,' said Rose. EOS 'You _do_ know all.' EOS 'I did.' EOS 'Not to press you to alter your determination,' pursued the young man, 'but to hear you repeat it, if you would. EOS 'The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,' said Rose firmly. EOS It is a struggle,' said Rose, 'but one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.' EOS 'Then why inflict it on yourself?' EOS 'And what have I heard! EOS Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. EOS It is a world of disappointment:  often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour. EOS A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. EOS A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay. EOS He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. EOS The jailer touched him on the shoulder. EOS The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it. EOS There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. EOS Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to think again. EOS He had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips. EOS What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? EOS Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses. EOS It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon. EOS He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. EOS He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. EOS If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other's heels, where would he be, when they came round again! EOS From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. EOS 'It's not a sight for children, sir.' EOS 'It is not indeed, my friend,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well--even at the cost of some pain and fear--that he should see him now.' EOS His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision. EOS 'Oliver, too, ha! EOS Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to bed!' EOS The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking. EOS 'Take him away to bed!' EOS It's worth the money to bring him up to it--Bolter's throat, Bill; never mind the girl--Bolter's throat as deep as you can cut. EOS 'An old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!' EOS Fagin, Fagin! EOS Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.' EOS 'For the love of God,' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, 'do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. EOS Where are those papers?' EOS Let me whisper to you.' EOS 'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. EOS Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.' EOS 'Say I've gone to sleep--they'll believe you. EOS The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned. EOS 'Press on, press on,' cried Fagin. EOS It was some time before they left the prison. EOS The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words. EOS By the provisions of his father's will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded. EOS Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind:  all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity. EOS He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year. EOS Mr. Noah Claypole:  receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin:  and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish:  was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work. EOS The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty. EOS And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures. EOS I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts.

EOS There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. EOS Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. EOS The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. EOS With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. EOS So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass. EOS The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey. EOS “Wo-ho!” said the coachman. EOS One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!”  “Halloa!” the guard replied. EOS Get on with you!”  The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. EOS “Tst! EOS Jarvis Lorry.”  Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. EOS The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully. EOS “He may come close; there's nothing wrong.”  “I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that,” said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. EOS And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before. EOS So now let's look at you.”  The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. EOS The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. EOS A crown to drink. EOS “That's a Blazing strange answer, too,”  said he, at his hoarsest. EOS “Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. EOS Make the best of your way. EOS I say, Jerry! EOS It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. EOS “No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. EOS “It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. EOS To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested. EOS As the bank passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. EOS Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. EOS I don't understand.”  After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands--to dig this wretched creature out. EOS The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel. EOS His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait. EOS He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. EOS We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”  “Yes, sir. EOS The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. EOS Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter. EOS As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too. EOS A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work. EOS Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard. EOS These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out. EOS “I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat. EOS “--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.”  “Myself.”  “As I was prepared to hear, sir.”  She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. EOS “I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. EOS I shall be more happy to execute it.”  “Sir, I thank you indeed. EOS I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”  “Story!”  He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers. EOS His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands. EOS In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. EOS These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment. EOS Now comes the difference. EOS “Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of business. EOS O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”  “A--a matter of business. EOS There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”  He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. EOS He is alive. EOS Still, alive. EOS She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,  “I am going to see his Ghost! EOS “There, there, there! EOS This is a secret service altogether. EOS “Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me? EOS My darling pretty!”  “I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”  “A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. EOS “If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?”  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it. EOS All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. EOS A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. EOS There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. EOS Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. EOS The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger. EOS Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. EOS Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil. EOS Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. EOS The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. EOS “It's not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders. EOS “The people from the market did it. EOS “Put it on, put it on,” said the other. EOS “Call wine, wine; and finish there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop. EOS This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder. EOS He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. EOS There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. EOS Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. EOS “How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. EOS When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line. EOS At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line. EOS This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat. EOS “Gentlemen--my wife!”  The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. EOS Their conference was very short, but very decided. EOS It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. EOS Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. EOS Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay. EOS Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. EOS Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what harm--if his door was left open.”  “Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry. EOS “Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. EOS But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance. EOS The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. EOS Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. EOS There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. EOS “I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur Defarge. EOS How do you choose them?”  “I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. EOS Enough; you are English; that is another thing. EOS A faint voice answered something. EOS “Come in, come in!”  “I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering. EOS “Of it? EOS Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. EOS Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes. EOS The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. EOS So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die. EOS He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which. EOS “What did you say?”  “Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”  “I can't say that I mean to. EOS Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. EOS He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. EOS It is a young lady's walking-shoe. EOS It is in the present mode. EOS Look at him. EOS Look at me. EOS Hush! EOS Hush!”  She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he sat. EOS There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour. EOS Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. EOS He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. EOS He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. EOS “She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. EOS I remember them very well.”  He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. EOS “How was this?--_Was it you_?”  Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness. EOS “Whose voice was that?”  His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy. EOS See what the prisoner is. EOS No, no. EOS But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. EOS If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! EOS O, see! EOS He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. EOS You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now. EOS Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. EOS The darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall. EOS He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke. EOS In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. EOS They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. EOS They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls. EOS An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. EOS Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps. EOS Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city gates. EOS Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black. EOS All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:  “I hope you care to be recalled to life?”  And the old answer:  “I can't say.”   The end of the first book. EOS After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. EOS Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. EOS Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. EOS People understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. EOS His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry. EOS But they were very decently kept. EOS your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your father's prosperity. EOS “They ain't worth much, then. EOS B-u-u-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his clothes, “if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with! EOS I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!”  Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah! EOS In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did, kept the required watch upon his mother. EOS On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,--and was almost as in-looking. EOS Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. EOS “Barbarous!”  “It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised spectacles upon him. EOS “Speak well of the law. EOS Take care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take care of itself. EOS Go along.”  Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one, too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and went his way. EOS But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. EOS Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in his letter through a trap in it. EOS “Nothing yet.”  “What's coming on?”  “The Treason case.”  “The quartering one, eh?”  “Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters. EOS they'll find him guilty,” said the other. EOS “Don't you be afraid of that.”  Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. EOS The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue. EOS He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet. EOS Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish. EOS Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada and North America. EOS When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life. EOS His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. EOS She had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. EOS The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry:  “Witnesses.”  “For which side?”  “Against.”  “Against what side?”  “The prisoner's.”  The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold. EOS That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. EOS When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become. EOS The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly. EOS Had he inherited it? EOS Two or three times. EOS Not five or six? EOS Perhaps. EOS Frequently? EOS Swear it was not true? EOS Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? EOS Certain. EOS Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? EOS Oh dear no. EOS No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? EOS None whatever. EOS He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago. EOS He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity--never thought of such a thing. EOS Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. EOS “Mr. EOS Lorry, look upon the prisoner. EOS Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. EOS Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?”  “No.”  “You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”  “No.”  “So at least you say he may have been one of them?”  “Yes. EOS Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?”  “He happened to be the only one.”  “Never mind about 'happening,' Mr. Lorry. EOS He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?”  “He was.”  “Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”  “With two companions. EOS I had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour. EOS He did it for me. EOS He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he felt it. EOS I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day.”  Buzzing from the blue-flies. EOS Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against. EOS Some three years, or three years and a half ago.”  “Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?”  “Sir, I can do neither.”  “Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?”  He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”  “Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”  He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”  “Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”  “They tell me so.”  “Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”  “None. EOS I have no remembrance of the process.”  Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together. EOS The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person. EOS “Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”  Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken. EOS My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned friend) for treason? EOS But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more. EOS Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. EOS Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?”  Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: “Officer! EOS He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since. EOS As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman. EOS It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”  Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar. EOS You have seen the worst of her agitation.”  “I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. EOS An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale. EOS The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them. EOS IV. EOS Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over. EOS He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay. EOS You are a man of business, too.”  “And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes. EOS He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. EOS The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. EOS He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. EOS We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. EOS This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?”  “I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this world again.”  “I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. EOS “That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! EOS “Do you call the whole reckoning?” said Carton. EOS You know I have been drinking.”  “Since I must say so, I know it.”  “Then you shall likewise know why. EOS I am a disappointed drudge, sir. EOS You might have used your talents better.”  “May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. EOS Come on, and have it out in plain words! EOS Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions. EOS Ten o'clock at night?”  “Yes, sir. EOS The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. EOS He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age. EOS “You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”  “Two to-night, I think. EOS Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips. EOS Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew. EOS “You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. EOS Every question told.”  “I always am sound; am I not?”  “I don't gainsay it. EOS Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!”  “Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! EOS You summon no energy and purpose. EOS “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”  Apparently not, for he became gloomy again. EOS “I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?”  “The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette.”  “_She_ pretty?”  “Is she not?”  “No.”  “Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”  “Rot the admiration of the whole Court! EOS Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? EOS When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert. EOS Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance. EOS There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. EOS As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season. EOS The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness. EOS The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. EOS Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. EOS His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted. EOS It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved. EOS “I am very much put out about my Ladybird.”  “Indeed?”  “For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness. EOS “Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment. EOS Yes, I am very much put out.”  “May I ask the cause?”  “I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross. EOS “As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”  “Never.”  “And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”  “Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. EOS To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? EOS Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”  “Can't be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. EOS She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. EOS The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going. EOS However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them. EOS Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. EOS Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her. EOS On this occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too. EOS Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. EOS She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the jerks.”  The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. EOS He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. EOS We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”  “_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. EOS Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. EOS What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”  “My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”  He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. EOS The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat. EOS When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight. EOS “Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. EOS When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my father's.”  “I take them into mine!” said Carton. EOS Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to bring the dead out of their graves.”  “I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what would do that,” answered Jerry. EOS Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. EOS Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook. EOS Yes. EOS It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. EOS The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. EOS As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. EOS Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places. EOS From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress. EOS Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! EOS As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it. EOS He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. EOS A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. EOS Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away. EOS It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. EOS The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner. EOS With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way. EOS But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles. EOS “What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out. EOS “Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is a child.”  “Why does he make that abominable noise? EOS Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. EOS It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. EOS All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten. EOS “Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier. EOS The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain. EOS “I passed you on the road?”  “Monseigneur, it is true. EOS “Monseigneur, the man.”  “May the Devil carry away these idiots! EOS Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience. EOS “Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. EOS Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis. EOS Go on!”  The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate. EOS To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. EOS Always petitions!”  “Monseigneur. EOS For the love of the great God! EOS He is dead.”  “Well! EOS But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass.”  “Well?”  “Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”  “Again, well?”  She looked an old woman, but was young. EOS Monseigneur!”  The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau. EOS By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished. EOS A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions. EOS As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago. EOS Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees. EOS The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry. EOS This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two others. EOS The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France. EOS A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour. EOS “Monseigneur? EOS He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. EOS He had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road. EOS He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to it. EOS “You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table. EOS “Yesterday. EOS “On the contrary; I come direct.”  “Pardon me! EOS His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument. EOS “We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France.”  “Let us hope so,” said the uncle. EOS Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs. EOS “Repression is the only lasting philosophy. EOS Shall we terminate our conference for the night?”  “A moment more.”  “An hour, if you please.”  “Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong.”  “_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself. EOS Why need I speak of my father's time, when it is equally yours? EOS “To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.”  “Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner. EOS A Doctor?”  “Yes.”  “With a daughter?”  “Yes.”  “Yes,” said the Marquis. EOS The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door. EOS “Good night!” said the uncle. EOS Good repose! EOS Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom. EOS The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night. EOS But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them. EOS Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads. EOS Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? EOS All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. EOS Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. EOS It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. EOS Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:  “Drive him fast to his tomb. EOS In this age, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. EOS As a tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. EOS He had expected labour, and he found it, and did it and made the best of it. EOS He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. EOS “Charles Darnay! EOS “Bring your chair here, and speak on.”  He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. EOS The latter so received it, and remained silent. EOS I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”  Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. EOS I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself. EOS Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference. EOS The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.”  “I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. EOS If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. EOS She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me--Well! EOS “You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. EOS “I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.”  “Stop!”  For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips. EOS If your suit should prosper, if Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. EOS “Give me your hand. EOS Go! EOS “My father!” she called to him. EOS The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time. EOS He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual. EOS XI. EOS Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. EOS “Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back. EOS “I am.”  “Now, look here! EOS I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. EOS “You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. EOS The young lady is Miss Manette. EOS You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.”  Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend. EOS You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way. EOS Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it. EOS Find out some respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. EOS The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver? EOS What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”  “My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. EOS Oh yes, you're eligible!” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “If you say eligible, you are eligible.”  “Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver. EOS “Now, I'll put you in a corner,” forensically shaking a forefinger at him. EOS “When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. EOS I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry, reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.”  The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn. EOS “Pray let there be no mistake about it.”  Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. EOS But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken. EOS Now, you think I may not be right?”  “Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. EOS “I can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. EOS Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in. EOS “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr. Stryver; “I'll do that for you.”  Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock, Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning. EOS He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state. EOS “I have been to Soho.”  “To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. EOS My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.”  “I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's account. EOS And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. EOS Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his mind. EOS Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood. EOS She had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. EOS But, looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed a change in it. EOS “I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”  “No. EOS What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”  “Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to live no better life?”  “God knows it is a shame!”  “Then why not change it?”  Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes. EOS There were tears in his voice too, as he answered:  “It is too late for that. EOS He knew her to be so, without looking at her, and said:  “Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. EOS He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden. EOS “If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. EOS In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me. EOS You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”  “Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? EOS Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”  “Thank you. EOS And again, God bless you.”  He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door. EOS “Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word. EOS An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets. EOS It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. EOS O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”  He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her. EOS “Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it's a buryin'.”  “Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry. EOS The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear. EOS What are you hooroaring at? EOS The position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! EOS Spies! EOS Spies! EOS Pull 'em out, there! EOS On the crowd's opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears. EOS They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. EOS The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief. EOS The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. EOS Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. EOS At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. EOS Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob. EOS Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers. EOS The place had a soothing influence on him. EOS You may as well go again me one way as another. EOS When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. EOS _I_'m your Rome, you know.”  Then he began grumbling again:  “With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! EOS He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night. EOS Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road. EOS Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. EOS It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath. EOS and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. EOS And then they began to fish. EOS They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. EOS By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface. EOS It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. EOS All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. EOS And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep. EOS From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. EOS Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”  “You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”  “It's enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn't. EOS Call yourself a religious woman? EOS Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. EOS Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. EOS “Hem! EOS As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. EOS A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol. EOS Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. EOS Except one man, who got up and went out. EOS Behold the manner of it. EOS “Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. EOS I make response, 'Tall as a spectre. EOS '”  “You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two. EOS “Go on!”  “Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. EOS But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. EOS 'Come on!' EOS His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. EOS They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself. EOS At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. EOS Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.”  The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky. EOS “On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. EOS How can the women and the children draw water! EOS When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”  The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him. EOS “That's all, messieurs. EOS With him, I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. EOS “To be registered?”  “To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge. EOS Without doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?”  “Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of it--not a syllable of it. EOS Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day.”  Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest. EOS until he absolutely wept with sentiment. EOS “You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make these fools believe that it will last for ever. EOS While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them. EOS When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:  “Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”  “Very little to-night, but all he knows. EOS There may be many more, for all that he can say, but he knows of one.”  “Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool business air. EOS His name?”  “Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. EOS “Good. EOS Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the night. EOS All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up and down through life. EOS Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”  “It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said Defarge. EOS “Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug. EOS I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. EOS But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you. EOS Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met the same fate. EOS Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day. EOS A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one. EOS It was curious. EOS The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop. EOS “Good day, madame,” said the new-comer. EOS “Good day, monsieur.”  She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting: “Hah! EOS She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. EOS The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. EOS “Stay long enough, and I shall knit 'BARSAD' before you go.”  “You have a husband, madame?”  “I have.”  “Children?”  “No children.”  “Business seems bad?”  “Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”  “Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! EOS _I_ think for others? EOS As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day, Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him. EOS “I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”  “No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. EOS “You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”  observed Defarge. EOS “Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. EOS “No,” said Defarge. EOS You English are cold, it seems to me.”  “Oh! EOS After sipping his cognac to the end, he added:  “Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. EOS But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. EOS ), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis. EOS The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind. EOS Darkness encompassed them. EOS She had reserved this last evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree. EOS But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you. EOS Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us? EOS If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. EOS Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”  “You, Lucie? EOS Can you follow me, Lucie? EOS “In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. EOS My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. EOS When they passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. EOS How little I thought what I was doing! EOS How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!”  “You didn't mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, “and therefore how could you know it? EOS Nonsense!”  “Really? EOS “I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “_you_ are.”  “I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.) EOS “You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. EOS There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said Miss Pross, “that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn't see it.”  “I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one. EOS He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. EOS It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. EOS “I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. EOS “Good God!” he said, with a start. EOS The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy. EOS Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. EOS This is not your proper occupation. EOS He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. EOS On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. EOS The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening. EOS On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night. EOS If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there? EOS Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. EOS The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast. EOS But, unfortunately, there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”  The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”  “Nine days and nights.”  “How did it show itself? EOS It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”  The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind. EOS Could a repetition of it be prevented? EOS What can I do for my friend? EOS No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how. EOS “But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. EOS “Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder. EOS But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. EOS It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a particular occasion. EOS “As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have great hope. EOS He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over.”  “Well, well! EOS I may go on?”  “You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him his hand. EOS The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. EOS He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”  “You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”  “I think I am quite sure of it.”  “My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--”  “My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. EOS There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”  “Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. EOS I am sure it does no good. EOS “In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. EOS On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. EOS The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and she had no suspicions. EOS On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross carrying a light. EOS There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. EOS “Mr. EOS I doubt if I should abuse the permission. EOS He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked. EOS What would you have me do, my Life?”  “I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. EOS I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now. EOS For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much. EOS Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves. EOS Her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal. EOS Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel. EOS O Father, blessed words! EOS No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. EOS What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. EOS As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped life of it. EOS here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. EOS He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to be caught.” Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way. EOS People are so unreasonable! EOS My tea, my dear! EOS Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. EOS Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. EOS People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. EOS Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day. EOS You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye.”  “Come, then!” cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. EOS Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. EOS Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. EOS “Work, comrades all, work! EOS “To me, women!” cried madame his wife. EOS “Quick!”  “The meaning, monsieur?”  “Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? EOS Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. EOS All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray. EOS There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. EOS “Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. EOS “And here he wrote 'a poor physician.' EOS And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone. EOS Here is my knife,”  throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw. EOS Light them, you!”  The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. EOS “See Defarge!” She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head. EOS The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them. EOS But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it. EOS Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! EOS The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them. EOS What is it?”  “News from the other world!”  “How, then?” cried madame, contemptuously. EOS But they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. EOS I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. EOS Say all! EOS _Had_ he reason?”  Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry. EOS The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter. EOS From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions. EOS With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot. EOS No. EOS They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets. EOS The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance from him in the Hall. EOS Ha, ha! EOS The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands. EOS Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. EOS Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless. EOS XXIII. EOS Fire Rises   There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. EOS Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken. EOS Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this. EOS Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable. EOS The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag. EOS They again joined hands. EOS “To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth. EOS “You go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--”  “To the Devil with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. EOS Well?”  “Well! EOS As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. EOS His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account. EOS The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe. EOS When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. EOS East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. EOS But, not for long. EOS Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. EOS Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire. EOS The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. EOS “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved. EOS “Help, gentlemen--officers! EOS In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. EOS Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination. EOS The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below. EOS A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! EOS Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels. EOS Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. EOS It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing. EOS And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints? EOS When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease. EOS Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. EOS Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none. EOS He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found. EOS “Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the polished Marquis who was murdered,” said one. EOS Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? EOS Well, but I'll answer you. EOS You may also tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. EOS But, no, gentlemen,” said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, “I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious _protégés_. EOS “Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry. EOS “MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS. EOS It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands. EOS “From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service. EOS He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete. EOS That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it. EOS Yes. EOS His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity. EOS He must go to Paris. EOS He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. EOS Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild. EOS As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. EOS He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. EOS “Gabelle.”  “Gabelle. EOS The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. EOS A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris. EOS “Choice! EOS Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap. EOS “As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”  “It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary. EOS The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. EOS But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. EOS An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”  He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and, resuming it as his safest place, said:  “Emigrant, my friends! EOS He will be judged at Paris.”  “Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. EOS Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his voice heard:  “Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. EOS That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.”  “But there are no such decrees yet?”  “What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there may be, or there will be. EOS He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate. EOS Is not that my right?”  “Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,” was the stolid reply. EOS Do you not believe it is the truth?”  “A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him. EOS You can say what it is.”  “In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?”  “You will see.”  “I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?”  “You will see. EOS But, what then? EOS Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.”  “But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”  Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence. EOS I am the sworn servant of both, against you. EOS And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. EOS How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind? EOS “In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. EOS The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there. EOS Surely, ghosts all. EOS “In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us. EOS He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever. EOS It struck cold and damp, but was not dark. EOS As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water. EOS II. EOS The Grindstone   Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. EOS He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror. EOS From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven. EOS But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet. EOS It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement. EOS Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. EOS “What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. EOS “What is the matter? EOS What has happened? EOS “What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window. EOS Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!”  The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile:  “My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. EOS “Don't look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. EOS You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. EOS The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise. EOS False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep. EOS Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. EOS Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. EOS If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. EOS For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of--“Live the Bastille prisoner! EOS He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew. EOS And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings! EOS “What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. EOS The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard. EOS Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. EOS She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house. EOS For answer he repeated, without any change of emphasis, the words:  “Do you know me?”  “I have seen you somewhere.”  “Perhaps at my wine-shop?”  Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor Manette?”  “Yes. EOS That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons. EOS Both the women followed; the second woman being The Vengeance. EOS There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. EOS I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”  Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence. EOS The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. EOS “It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. EOS “I have seen them. EOS We have known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough? EOS All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”  “We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance. EOS “We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie. EOS “Judge you! EOS That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. EOS The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. EOS Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. EOS With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it. EOS For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. EOS As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. EOS What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened! EOS And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. EOS Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. EOS So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun. EOS Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. EOS When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day. EOS “Walking here again, citizeness?”  “You see me, citizen!”  The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely. EOS And went on sawing his wood. EOS “What? EOS I call it my Little Guillotine. EOS And off his head comes!”  The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket. EOS On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. EOS Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death! EOS The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. EOS But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. EOS They advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped. EOS No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. EOS It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart. EOS There is no one here to see. EOS Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every protection. EOS I must see Lorry.”  He stopped. EOS A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. EOS Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death! EOS His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. EOS They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. EOS And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them. EOS His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. EOS The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. EOS They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else. EOS Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress. EOS “Take off his head!” cried the audience. EOS Was he not an emigrant then? EOS He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette. EOS the President reminded him. EOS Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. EOS On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. EOS The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang his bell to quiet them. EOS The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. EOS Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called Darnay. EOS They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages. EOS Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. EOS Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms. EOS As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. EOS After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms. EOS When she was again in his arms, he said to her:  “And now speak to your father, dearest. EOS No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me.”  She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor head on her own breast, long, long ago. EOS He was happy in the return he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength. EOS Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night. EOS Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. EOS She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be. EOS “Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; “if you are ready, I am.”  Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. EOS “There's all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall have a precious time of it. EOS Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie. EOS Again?” Lucie remonstrated. EOS Cruncher!--Don't you move, Ladybird!”  They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire. EOS Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. EOS The least thing--nothing--startles you! EOS Hide Charles. EOS A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room. EOS “Who seeks him?” answered Darnay. EOS The People is supreme. EOS Truly it is against rule. EOS Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! EOS After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her fancy. EOS Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier. EOS No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands. EOS What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. EOS “What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English. EOS “Does he think me a ghost?”  Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. EOS As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits. EOS There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own. EOS You want to be the death of me. EOS “Far rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall. EOS As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her money and left her! EOS He had not previously uttered a word. EOS She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. EOS And _I_ know you're John, you know. EOS And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. EOS What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?”  “Barsad,” said another voice, striking in. EOS “That's the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry. EOS I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”  Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. EOS I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. EOS “It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. EOS His practised eye saw it, and made the most of it. EOS Come then!”  Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. EOS She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed. EOS I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!”  “Arrested for all that. EOS “Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. EOS But it may not be so. EOS I own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest.”  “He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry. EOS Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. EOS Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. EOS And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.”  “You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy. EOS I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.”  It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away. EOS “Mr. EOS Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. EOS That's an excellent card. EOS “Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. EOS He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. EOS Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over. EOS “You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest composure. EOS “You think not, sir?”  “I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”  The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and failed him. EOS You don't know him,” said the spy, quickly. EOS “French, eh?” repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him at all, though he echoed his word. EOS “Can't-be. EOS We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”  “Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give me an advantage over you. EOS His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.”  Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. EOS Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff. EOS No! EOS Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it's you I have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen! EOS “I hold another card, Mr. Barsad. EOS A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. EOS I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham. EOS Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”     IX. EOS If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you get back to England. EOS There'd be two sides to it. EOS Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at it! EOS Upon that there stool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. EOS I want no more words.”  Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room. EOS “It is all I could do,” said Carton. EOS “To propose too much, would be to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. EOS It was obviously the weakness of the position. EOS There is no help for it.”  “But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him.”  “I never said it would.”  Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell. EOS “She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would only add to her trouble. EOS How does she look?”  “Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”  “Ah!”  It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. EOS It attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the fire. EOS “And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning to him. EOS I have my Leave to Pass. EOS How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!”  “A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. EOS Wouldn't her child?”  “Yes, yes, thank God. EOS I didn't quite mean what I said.”  “It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?”  “Surely, surely.”  “If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, 'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!' EOS He had heard of her going to the prison every day. EOS Let me follow in her steps.”  It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. EOS “Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively. EOS Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. EOS Ha, ha, ha! EOS Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! EOS Word of honour!”  As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away. EOS Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with his own hands. EOS “There is nothing more to do,” said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. EOS I can't sleep.”  It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance. EOS Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged. EOS “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”  Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. EOS Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial. EOS Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.”  “Good.”  “Therese Defarge, his wife.”  “Good.”  “Alexandre Manette, physician.”  A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated. EOS Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. EOS This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work. EOS You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. EOS As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. EOS I examine it, very closely. EOS In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. EOS The Substance of the Shadow   “I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. EOS I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it. EOS Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust. EOS Hope has quite departed from my breast. EOS I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat. EOS The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. EOS “'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.' EOS “I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. EOS Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place. EOS “There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. EOS I was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed. EOS My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight. EOS and would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!' EOS There was no variation in the order, or the manner. EOS “To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. EOS “He answered with great contempt, 'No.' EOS “The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?' EOS “'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how useless I am, as you have brought me! EOS *****  “I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips. EOS If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those. EOS The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. EOS *****  “The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable. EOS “'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.' EOS He was then dying fast. EOS “'How has this been done, monsieur?' EOS “'A crazed young common dog! EOS Forced my brother to draw upon him, and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.' EOS They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. EOS I know it, and have heard my father say so. EOS We were all tenants of his--that man's who stands there. EOS “It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis. EOS He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. EOS Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.' EOS “Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. EOS I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be _his_ vassal. EOS I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle. EOS That weapon was a gentleman's. EOS “'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. EOS “I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. EOS I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it. EOS I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. EOS It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her. EOS asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse. EOS “'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.' EOS “He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. EOS Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest. EOS “I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering. EOS *****  “I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. EOS It was in vain that I asked her for her family name. EOS She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done. EOS “I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. EOS Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. EOS The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous. EOS “'At last she is dead?' EOS “'She is dead,' said I. EOS “'Pray excuse me,' said I. EOS *****  “I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. EOS From the first, I had anxiously considered what I ought to do. EOS I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. EOS “The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. EOS She was in great agitation. EOS “She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her greatest desire was, to help that sister. EOS Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both. EOS I must finish my record to-day. EOS When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage. EOS What I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.' EOS I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him. EOS I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day. EOS “That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. EOS It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting. EOS Not a word was spoken. EOS And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for. EOS A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. EOS Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time. EOS The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation. EOS And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. EOS Back to the Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours! EOS XI. EOS Dusk   The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. EOS The quick noise and movement of the court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation. EOS If I might embrace him once! EOS My parting blessing on my love. EOS We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty. EOS “All things have worked together as they have fallen out. EOS “Don't recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is better so. EOS Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”  “Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. EOS O, look at her, dear Carton! EOS He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother. EOS These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”  “Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. EOS Within an hour or two from this.”  “It will be dark soon after four. EOS I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. EOS XII. EOS Let me think it out!”  Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. EOS As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair. EOS This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in. EOS The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment. EOS As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered. EOS “Ah! EOS and good wine. EOS After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation. EOS “Yes. EOS I have observed his face. EOS I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison. EOS Let me but lift my finger--!” She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped. EOS “The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman. EOS But I would leave the matter there. EOS The English customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. EOS At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety. EOS In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor. EOS They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs. EOS “Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to work. EOS Give me my work.”  Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, like a distracted child. EOS As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping. EOS But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me? EOS “Say on.”  The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. EOS Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. EOS Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. EOS First,” he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. EOS You see--Sydney Carton, an Englishman?”  Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face. EOS I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”  “Why not?”  “I don't know; I prefer not to do so. EOS Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. EOS It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier! EOS Now, observe! EOS You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. EOS “You are a noble heart. EOS Did I say we could depend upon no better man? EOS “For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. EOS Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another.”  “Nothing, Carton.”  “Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed.”  “I will remember them. EOS Now, good bye!”  Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. EOS XIII. EOS Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart. EOS There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. EOS Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished. EOS He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. EOS He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. EOS Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father. EOS And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending. EOS To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs. EOS He never thought of Carton. EOS When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world. EOS A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him. EOS Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”  Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall. EOS How high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times. EOS Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear. EOS Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own. EOS He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. EOS He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them. EOS Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,” and turned to walk again. EOS There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining. EOS “Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said. EOS I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. EOS “I bring you a request from her.”  “What is it?”  “A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well remember.”  The prisoner turned his face partly aside. EOS Dear Carton! EOS I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”  “Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? EOS Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. EOS “Do I date it?”  “No.”  The prisoner looked up, at each question. EOS Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. EOS You do remember them, I know. EOS It is not in your nature to forget them. EOS “Have you written 'forget them'?” Carton asked. EOS The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. EOS Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. EOS “You see?” said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your hazard very great?”  “Mr. EOS “Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now? EOS “I know it well,” answered Carton. EOS Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual. EOS A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying, “Follow me, Evremonde!” and he followed into a large dark room, at a distance. EOS “I am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”  He murmured for answer: “True. EOS Is it likely? EOS “I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde.

EOS The Knitting Done   In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. EOS The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited. EOS Eh?”  “There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, “in France.”  “Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, “hear me speak. EOS I have seen with my eyes.”  He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen. EOS “Yet once more! EOS “He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge. EOS “I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. EOS After it is over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these people at my Section.”  The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness. EOS Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.”  “I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek. EOS The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments. EOS It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. EOS It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. EOS Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. EOS Forbid it as we shouldn't all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal risk! EOS “If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't that be best?”  Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best. EOS “Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross. EOS “Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?”  “No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher. EOS There! EOS Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! EOS The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. EOS She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once. EOS Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. EOS Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch. EOS “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. EOS “On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. EOS I demand to see her. EOS Let me look.”  “Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. EOS In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help. EOS By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. EOS In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. EOS You can hear that, miss?”  “I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing. EOS XV. EOS Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. EOS Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before. EOS Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. EOS Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. EOS He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl. EOS “And why not, citizen?”  “He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.

EOS Therese Defarge!”  “She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood. EOS “No; nor will she miss now,” cries The Vengeance, petulantly. EOS Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardly bring her. EOS And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here! EOS He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he promised. EOS “But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day. EOS I think you were sent to me by Heaven.”  “Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton. EOS “Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object.”  “I mind nothing while I hold your hand.

EOS Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. EOS ; Cratyl. EOS It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. EOS The two philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. EOS In English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. EOS That there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. EOS Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literature on politics. EOS The tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole, in which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined, and the happiness of the citizens in this life, which has now been assured, is crowned by the vision of another. EOS There is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a time, or turned from one work to another; and such interruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing. EOS In all attempts to determine the chronological order of the Platonic writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single Dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be admitted to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more than shorter ones. EOS In the beginnings of literature and philosophy, amid the first efforts of thought and language, more inconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of speculation are well worn and the meaning of words precisely defined. EOS For consistency, too, is the growth of time; and some of the greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in unity. EOS Or, described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is within, and yet developes into a Church or external kingdom; 'the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,' is reduced to the proportions of an earthly building. EOS 47). EOS There is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether of nature or of art, are referred to design. EOS The reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the whole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most general. EOS Thus Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary explanations of the argument of the Republic, imagines himself to have found the true argument 'in the representation of human life in a State perfected by justice, and governed according to the idea of good.' EOS Every shade of light and dark, of truth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination. EOS The writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole; they take possession of him and are too much for him. EOS We have no need therefore to discuss whether a State such as Plato has conceived is practicable or not, or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer. EOS ), only aims at general probability. EOS Whether all the persons mentioned in the Republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an Athenian reading the work forty years later, or to Plato himself at the time of writing (any more than to Shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatly trouble us now. EOS He is eager that Socrates should come to visit him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the consciousness of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts. EOS As Cicero remarks (Ep. EOS He has not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon and Adeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he belongs to the pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. EOS He is incapable of arguing, and is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he does not know what he is saying. EOS He is vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond of making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable Socrates; but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that the next 'move' (to use a Platonic expression) will 'shut him up.' EOS The state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process of the argument. EOS At first he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent good-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two occasional remarks. EOS Rhet. EOS Mem. EOS iii. EOS It is Glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state of simplicity is 'a city of pigs,' who is always prepared with a jest when the argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second the humour of Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs of music, or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of democracy. EOS In the discussion about religion and mythology, Adeimantus is the respondent, but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end of the book. EOS Once more Adeimantus returns with the allusion to his brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious State; in the next book he is again superseded, and Glaucon continues to the end. EOS He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the old enemy of the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well as to argue seriously. EOS There is no evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect state were comprehended in the Socratic teaching, though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. EOS Xen. EOS But any one can see that this is a mere form, of which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances. EOS The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, when he describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an investigation, but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the answer to a question more fluently than another. EOS Thus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in Book VI. EOS When the rhetorical advantage of reciting the Dialogue has been gained, the attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor is the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the narrative. EOS Yes, replies Socrates, but the world will say, Cephalus, that you are happy in old age because you are rich. EOS Socrates remarks that Cephalus appears not to care about riches, a quality which he ascribes to his having inherited, not acquired them, and would like to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them. EOS The portrait of the just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse which follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about the nature of justice, there is no difficulty in discerning 'who is a just man.' EOS 'No, not in that case, not if the parties are friends, and evil would result. EOS He meant that you were to do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.' EOS Every act does something to somebody; and following this analogy, Socrates asks, What is this due and proper thing which justice does, and to whom? EOS The answer is that justice is of use in contracts, and contracts are money partnerships. EOS 'When you want to have money safely kept and not used.' EOS Then justice will be useful when money is useless. EOS Can justice produce injustice any more than the art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold? EOS The final conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just return evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man, Periander, Perdiccas, or Ismenias the Theban (about B.C. EOS He then prohibits all the ordinary definitions of justice; to which Socrates replies that he cannot tell how many twelve is, if he is forbidden to say 2 x 6, or 3 x 4, or 6 x 2, or 4 x 3. EOS Thrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion, when he makes a bold diversion. EOS The satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and apparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced. EOS Now, as you and I, Glaucon, are not convinced by him, we must reply to him; but if we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to decide for us; we had better therefore proceed by making mutual admissions of the truth to one another. EOS Socrates praises his frankness, and assumes the attitude of one whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his opponents. EOS The admission is elicited from him that the just man seeks to gain an advantage over the unjust only, but not over the just, while the unjust would gain an advantage over either. EOS Thus the skilled falls on the side of the good, and the unskilled on the side of the evil, and the just is the skilled, and the unjust is the unskilled. EOS A house that is divided against itself cannot stand; two men who quarrel detract from one another's strength, and he who is at war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods. EOS Justice and happiness being thus shown to be inseparable, the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier has disappeared. EOS First of all the nature of justice was the subject of our enquiry, and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and folly; and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust: and the sum of all is that I know not what justice is; how then shall I know whether the just is happy or not?... EOS 'Justice is like the arts (1) in having no external interest, and (2) in not aiming at excess, and (3) justice is to happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.' EOS They only saw the points of agreement in them and not the points of difference. EOS Eth. EOS The expression 'an art of pay' which is described as 'common to all the arts' is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language. EOS Nor is it employed elsewhere either by Plato or by any other Greek writer. EOS It is suggested by the argument, and seems to extend the conception of art to doing as well as making. EOS That the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly Hellenic sentiment, which may be compared with the language of those modern writers who speak of virtue as fitness, and of freedom as obedience to law. EOS Ideas of measure, equality, order, unity, proportion, still linger in the writings of moralists; and the true spirit of the fine arts is better conveyed by such terms than by superlatives. EOS The final reconcilement of justice and happiness and the identity of the individual and the State are also intimated. EOS Socrates reassumes the character of a 'know-nothing;' at the same time he appears to be not wholly satisfied with the manner in which the argument has been conducted. EOS Thrasymachus is pacified, but the intrepid Glaucon insists on continuing the argument. EOS He begins by dividing goods into three classes:--first, goods desirable in themselves; secondly, goods desirable in themselves and for their results; thirdly, goods desirable for their results only. EOS In the second class, replies Socrates, among goods desirable for themselves and also for their results. EOS 'Then the world in general are of another mind, for they say that justice belongs to the troublesome class of goods which are desirable for their results only. EOS Socrates answers that this is the doctrine of Thrasymachus which he rejects. EOS Men may praise him in public out of fear for themselves, but they will laugh at him in their hearts (Cp. EOS I was thinking what to answer, when Adeimantus joined in the already unequal fray. EOS There are the pictures in Homer and Hesiod of fat sheep and heavy fleeces, rich corn-fields and trees toppling with fruit, which the gods provide in this life for the just. EOS And the Orphic poets add a similar picture of another. EOS Some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth generation. EOS But the wicked they bury in a slough and make them carry water in a sieve: and in this life they attribute to them the infamy which Glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just who are supposed to be unjust. EOS To appearance then I will turn,--I will put on the show of virtue and trail behind me the fox of Archilochus. EOS And please, as Glaucon said, to exclude reputation; let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice'... EOS All such theories have a kind of plausibility from their partial agreement with experience. EOS For human nature oscillates between good and evil, and the motives of actions and the origin of institutions may be explained to a certain extent on either hypothesis according to the character or point of view of a particular thinker. EOS A little experience may make a man a cynic; a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier view of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men. EOS An ideal is none the worse because 'some one has made the discovery' that no such ideal was ever realized. EOS Nor again, (2) must we forget that Plato, though he agrees generally with the view implied in the argument of the two brothers, is not expressing his own final conclusion, but rather seeking to dramatize one of the aspects of ethical truth. EOS Glaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the happiness of the unjust, to which the misery of the tyrant in Book IX is the answer and parallel. EOS But now Adeimantus, taking up the hint which had been already given by Glaucon, proceeds to show that in the opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of rewards and reputation, and points out the advantage which is given to such arguments as those of Thrasymachus and Glaucon by the conventional morality of mankind. EOS Both the brothers touch upon the question, whether the morality of actions is determined by their consequences; and both of them go beyond the position of Socrates, that justice belongs to the class of goods not desirable for themselves only, but desirable for themselves and for their results, to which he recalls them. EOS In their attempt to view justice as an internal principle, and in their condemnation of the poets, they anticipate him. EOS It has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but is taken by Socrates to mean all virtue. EOS But first he dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man to his natural condition, before he will answer the question at all. EOS in the perfect State, justice and happiness will coincide, and that when justice has been once found, happiness may be left to take care of itself. EOS That he falls into some degree of inconsistency, when in the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the rewards and honours of justice, may be admitted; for he has left those which exist in the perfect State. EOS Still he maintains the true attitude of moral action. EOS 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.' EOS First ethics, then politics--this is the order of ideas to us; the reverse is the order of history. EOS In early ages he is not ONE, but one of many, the citizen of a State which is prior to him; and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law of his country or the creed of his church. EOS The good man and the good citizen only coincide in the perfect State; and this perfection cannot be attained by legislation acting upon them from without, but, if at all, by education fashioning them from within. EOS Society arises out of the wants of man. EOS And we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the citizens with one another justice and injustice will appear. EOS They spend their days in houses which they have built for themselves; they make their own clothes and produce their own corn and wine. EOS 'But,' said Glaucon, interposing, 'are they not to have a relish?' EOS Certainly; they will have salt and olives and cheese, vegetables and fruits, and chestnuts to roast at the fire. EOS Then the fine arts must go to work--every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be wanted. EOS But these spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one another; the union of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears to be an impossibility, and the guardian of a State requires both qualities. EOS The image of the dog suggests an answer. EOS Your dog is a philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing; and philosophy, whether in man or beast, is the parent of gentleness. EOS Some of them are very improper, as we may see in the great instances of Homer and Hesiod, who not only tell lies but bad lies; stories about Uranus and Saturn, which are immoral as well as false, and which should never be spoken of to young persons, or indeed at all; or, if at all, then in a mystery, after the sacrifice, not of an Eleusinian pig, but of some unprocurable animal. EOS If any one asks what tales are to be allowed, we will answer that we are legislators and not book-makers; we only lay down the principles according to which books are to be written; to write them is the duty of others. EOS And our first principle is, that God must be represented as he is; not as the author of all things, but of good only. EOS Either these were not the actions of the gods, or God was just, and men were the better for being punished. EOS And the second principle is like unto it:--With God is no variableness or change of form. EOS He indulges, like Rousseau, in a picture of primitive life--an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence on the imagination of mankind, but he does not seriously mean to say that one is better than the other (Politicus); nor can any inference be drawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the second, such as Aristotle appears to draw in the Politics. EOS Several interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in a treatise on Political Economy are scattered up and down the writings of Plato: especially Laws, Population; Free Trade; Adulteration; Wills and Bequests; Begging; Eryxias, (though not Plato's), Value and Demand; Republic, Division of Labour. EOS The last subject, and also the origin of Retail Trade, is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of the Republic. EOS The disappointment of Glaucon at the 'city of pigs,' the ludicrous description of the ministers of luxury in the more refined State, and the afterthought of the necessity of doctors, the illustration of the nature of the guardian taken from the dog, the desirableness of offering some almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to be celebrated, the behaviour of Zeus to his father and of Hephaestus to his mother, are touches of humour which have also a serious meaning. EOS A Greek in the age of Plato attached no importance to the question whether his religion was an historical fact. EOS And so in all religions: the consideration of their morality comes first, afterwards the truth of the documents in which they are recorded, or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of them. EOS The facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst the most important of all facts; but they are frequently uncertain, and we only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we place ourselves above them. EOS And so without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two forms of religion, the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and the customary worship of the temple; on the other hand, there was the religion of the philosopher, who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas, but did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to Aesculapius, or to be seen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun. EOS BOOK III. EOS Such tales may have their use; but they are not the proper food for soldiers. EOS Nor must we allow our citizens to receive bribes, or to say, 'Gifts persuade the gods, gifts reverend kings;' or to applaud the ignoble advice of Phoenix to Achilles that he should get money out of the Greeks before he assisted them; or the meanness of Achilles himself in taking gifts from Agamemnon; or his requiring a ransom for the body of Hector; or his cursing of Apollo; or his insolence to the river-god Scamander; or his dedication to the dead Patroclus of his own hair which had been already dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius; or his cruelty in dragging the body of Hector round the walls, and slaying the captives at the pyre: such a combination of meanness and cruelty in Cheiron's pupil is inconceivable. EOS The youth who believes that such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing in their veins will be too ready to imitate their example. EOS Enough of gods and heroes;--what shall we say about men? EOS Such misrepresentations cannot be allowed by us. EOS The subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated; next follows style. EOS The man who has no self-respect, on the contrary, will imitate anybody and anything; sounds of nature and cries of animals alike; his whole performance will be imitation of gesture and voice. EOS Two remain--the Dorian and Phrygian, the first for war, the second for peace; the one expressive of courage, the other of obedience or instruction or religious feeling. EOS Thus we have made a purgation of music, and will now make a purgation of metres. EOS These should be like the harmonies, simple and suitable to the occasion. EOS This principle of simplicity has to be learnt by every one in the days of his youth, and may be gathered anywhere, from the creative and constructive arts, as well as from the forms of plants and animals. EOS He who violates it cannot be allowed to work in our city, and to corrupt the taste of our citizens. EOS There is a music of the soul which answers to the harmony of the world; and the fairest object of a musical soul is the fair mind in the fair body. EOS Next we pass on to gymnastics; about which I would remark, that the soul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if we educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge, and need only give a general outline of the course to be pursued. EOS Sicilian cookery and Attic confections and Corinthian courtezans, which are to gymnastic what Lydian and Ionian melodies are to music, must be forbidden. EOS How simple is the Homeric practice of medicine. EOS But Asclepius would not practise this art, because he knew that the citizens of a well-ordered State have no leisure to be ill, and therefore he adopted the 'kill or cure' method, which artisans and labourers employ. EOS But how can excessive care of health be inconsistent with an ordinary occupation, and yet consistent with that practice of virtue which Phocylides inculcates? EOS The physician should have had experience of disease in his own body, for he cures with his mind and not with his body. EOS When young a good man is apt to be deceived by evil-doers, because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and therefore the judge should be of a certain age; his youth should have been innocent, and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the practice of it, but by the observation of it in others. EOS This is the sort of medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our State; they will be healing arts to better natures; but the evil body will be left to die by the one, and the evil soul will be put to death by the other. EOS The two together supply our guardians with their twofold nature. EOS Too little spirit is easily exhausted; too much quickly passes into nervous irritability. EOS So, again, the athlete by feeding and training has his courage doubled, but he soon grows stupid; he is like a wild beast, ready to do everything by blows and nothing by counsel or policy. EOS The next question is, Who are to be our rulers? EOS What I am going to tell is only another version of the legend of Cadmus; but our unbelieving generation will be slow to accept such a story. EOS The tale must be imparted, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, lastly to the people. EOS We will inform them that their youth was a dream, and that during the time when they seemed to be undergoing their education they were really being fashioned in the earth, who sent them up when they were ready; and that they must protect and cherish her whose children they are, and regard each other as brothers and sisters. EOS There is more behind. EOS These brothers and sisters have different natures, and some of them God framed to rule, whom he fashioned of gold; others he made of silver, to be auxiliaries; others again to be husbandmen and craftsmen, and these were formed by him of brass and iron. EOS Now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers, and look about and pitch their camp in a high place, which will be safe against enemies from without, and likewise against insurrections from within. EOS There let them sacrifice and set up their tents; for soldiers they are to be and not shopkeepers, the watchdogs and guardians of the sheep; and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants. EOS He does not, like Heracleitus, get into a rage with Homer and Archilochus (Heracl. EOS The real, like the Platonic Socrates, as we gather from the Memorabilia of Xenophon, was fond of making similar adaptations. EOS Great in all ages and countries, in religion as well as in law and literature, has been the art of interpretation. EOS We cannot deny that the thought often exceeds the power of lucid expression in Aeschylus and Pindar; or that rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the Sophist-poet Euripides. EOS There are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets which are far too obscure; in which there is no proportion between style and subject, in which any half-expressed figure, any harsh construction, any distorted collocation of words, any remote sequence of ideas is admitted; and there is no voice 'coming sweetly from nature,' or music adding the expression of feeling to thought. EOS The thought of our own times has not out-stripped language; a want of Plato's 'art of measuring' is the rule cause of the disproportion between them. EOS For though the poets are to be expelled, still art is recognized as another aspect of reason--like love in the Symposium, extending over the same sphere, but confined to the preliminary education, and acting through the power of habit; and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or the forms of plastic art, but pervades all nature and has a wide kindred in the world. EOS Whether or no, like some writers, he felt more than he expressed, it is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost entire silence about them. EOS In one very striking passage he tells us that a work of art, like the State, is a whole; and this conception of a whole and the love of the newly-born mathematical sciences may be regarded, if not as the inspiring, at any rate as the regulating principles of Greek art (Xen. EOS 4. EOS The union of gentleness and courage in Book ii. EOS And Plato might also have found that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence of it. EOS And the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural sense independent of any special experience of good or evil. EOS In the Spartan state there had been enfranchisement of Helots and degradation of citizens under special circumstances. EOS The founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors, who were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of humanity; at a later period, the services of warriors and legislators were held to entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of citizenship and to the first rank in the state. EOS The gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told, and the analogy of Greek tradition, are a sufficient verification of the 'monstrous falsehood.' EOS Ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and iron age succeeding one another, but Plato supposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a single state. EOS Mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be taught (as Protagoras says, 'the myth is more interesting'), and also enables Plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into details. EOS In this passage he shadows forth a general truth, but he does not tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected. EOS 6. EOS They rise above sense, and become a connecting link with the world of ideas. EOS The effect of national airs may bear some comparison with it. EOS Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times break asunder and take up arms against one another? EOS And then the body becomes the good friend or ally, or servant or instrument of the mind. EOS We are also responsible for our health, although into this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which may be beyond our control. EOS (2) The tentative manner in which here, as in the second book, he proceeds with the construction of the State. EOS (5) The companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the valetudinarian, the satirical jest about the maxim of Phocylides, the manner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up into the subject, and the argument from the practice of Asclepius, should not escape notice. EOS BOOK IV. EOS 'Well, and what answer do you give?' EOS To the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity; it must be neither too large nor too small to be one. EOS And now what remains of the work of legislation? EOS It may be admitted further that right and utility are co-extensive, and that he who makes the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest and noblest motives of human action. EOS The greatest happiness of all is, as we believe, the far-off result of the divine government of the universe. EOS The word happiness has not the definiteness or the sacredness of 'truth' and 'right'; it does not equally appeal to our higher nature, and has not sunk into the conscience of mankind. EOS For these reasons 'the greatest happiness' principle is not the true foundation of ethics. EOS The same question reappears in politics, where the useful or expedient seems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority. EOS For concerning political measures, we chiefly ask: How will they affect the happiness of mankind? EOS In the most commercial and utilitarian states of society the power of ideas remains. EOS And this is the order of thought in Plato; first, he expects his citizens to do their duty, and then under favourable circumstances, that is to say, in a well-ordered State, their happiness is assured. EOS And if this small ruling class have wisdom, then the whole State will be wise. EOS Courage may be defined as a sort of salvation--the never-failing salvation of the opinions which law and education have prescribed concerning dangers. EOS The way is dark and difficult; but we must push on. EOS From the two together a brilliant light may be struck out...  Socrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of residues. EOS If there be a fourth virtue, that can only be sought for in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in the State to one another. EOS For the definition here given of justice is verbally the same as one of the definitions of temperance given by Socrates in the Charmides, which however is only provisional, and is afterwards rejected. EOS Nic. EOS Ethics), 'Whether the virtues are one or many?' EOS Both might be equally described by the terms 'law,' 'order,' 'harmony;' but while the idea of good embraces 'all time and all existence,' the conception of justice is not extended beyond man. EOS His argument is as follows:--Quantity makes no difference in quality. EOS Well then, you would admit that the qualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose them? EOS And one form of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises a new point--thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of warm drink or of a particular kind of food, with the single exception of course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is good. EOS But on the other hand, a particular knowledge is of a particular subject. EOS Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'Drink;' the rational one, which says 'Do not drink.' EOS There is a story of a certain Leontius which throws some light on this question. EOS This is passion or spirit, of the separate existence of which we may further convince ourselves by putting the following case:--When a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant at the hardships which he undergoes: but when he suffers unjustly, his indignation is his great support; hunger and thirst cannot tame him; the spirit within him must do or die, until the voice of the shepherd, that is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no more, is heard within. EOS For wisdom and courage and justice in the State are severally the wisdom and courage and justice in the individuals who form the State. EOS The courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves a right opinion about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains. EOS Come up with me to the hill which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of virtue, and the infinite forms of vice, among which are four special ones, characteristic both of states and of individuals. EOS But the path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he will not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. EOS But suppose that we allow the term 'thirst' or 'desire' to be modified, and say an 'angry thirst,' or a 'revengeful desire,' then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become confused. EOS These are the discussions of an age before logic; and any one who is wearied by them should remember that they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first development of the human faculties. EOS It differs from anger (Greek), this latter term having no accessory notion of righteous indignation. EOS The feeling of 'righteous indignation' is too partial and accidental to admit of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit. EOS We may observe how nearly Plato approaches Aristotle's famous thesis, that 'good actions produce good habits.' EOS BOOK V. I was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in states, when Polemarchus--he was sitting a little farther from me than Adeimantus--taking him by the coat and leaning towards him, said something in an undertone, of which I only caught the words, 'Shall we let him off?' EOS 'Certainly not,' said Adeimantus, raising his voice. EOS Whom, I said, are you not going to let off? EOS 'You,' he said. EOS Well, I said, the subject has several difficulties--What is possible? EOS is the second. EOS That, I replied, is a sorry consolation; I shall destroy my friends as well as myself. EOS All is habit: people have at last found out that the exposure is better than the concealment of the person, and now they laugh no more. EOS For we started originally with the division of labour; and the diversity of employments was based on the difference of natures. EOS We do not consider that the difference may be purely nominal and accidental; for example, a bald man and a hairy man are opposed in a single point of view, but you cannot infer that because a bald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. EOS If however their natures are the same, the inference is that their education must also be the same; there is no longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning music and gymnastic. EOS I meant to have escaped the trouble of proving the first, but as you have detected the little stratagem I must even submit. EOS Only allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his walks, with a dream of what might be, and then I will return to the question of what can be. EOS After the selection has been made, they will dwell in common houses and have their meals in common, and will be brought together by a necessity more certain than that of mathematics. EOS For the avoidance of this, holy marriage festivals will be instituted, and their holiness will be in proportion to their usefulness. EOS And here, Glaucon, I should like to ask (as I know that you are a breeder of birds and animals), Do you not take the greatest care in the mating? EOS And there is no reason to suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human beings. EOS Hymeneal festivals will be celebrated at times fixed with an eye to population, and the brides and bridegrooms will meet at them; and by an ingenious system of lots the rulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come together, and that those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors--the latter will ascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers. EOS The trouble of watching and getting up at night will be transferred to attendants. EOS And quite right too, I said, that they should. EOS The parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be reckoned at thirty years--from twenty-five, when he has 'passed the point at which the speed of life is greatest,' to fifty-five; and at twenty years for a woman--from twenty to forty. EOS This latter regulation applies to those who are within the specified ages, after which they may range at will, provided they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children, or of brothers and sisters, which last, however, are not absolutely prohibited, if a dispensation be procured. EOS Then again the citizens will have all things in common, in having common property they will have common pleasures and pains. EOS But no younger man will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from laying hands on his kindred, and he will fear that the rest of the family may retaliate. EOS Compared with the citizens of other States, ours will be Olympic victors, and crowned with blessings greater still--they and their children having a better maintenance during life, and after death an honourable burial. EOS Nor has the happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the State; our Olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler, but he has a happiness beyond that of any cobbler. EOS The young creatures should be placed under the care of experienced veterans, and they should have wings--that is to say, swift and tractable steeds on which they may fly away and escape. EOS One of the first things to be done is to teach a youth to ride. EOS The next question is, How shall we treat our enemies? EOS Again, the arms of Hellenes should not be offered up in the temples of the Gods; they are a pollution, for they are taken from brethren. EOS I would reduce them to a single one--the great wave, as I call it. EOS And first, I must explain of whom I speak and what sort of natures these are who are to be philosophers and rulers. EOS The snub-nosed youth is said to have a winning grace; the beak of another has a royal look; the featureless are faultless; the dark are manly, the fair angels; the sickly have a new term of endearment invented expressly for them, which is 'honey-pale.' EOS 'But will curiosity make a philosopher? EOS Are the lovers of sights and sounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the Dionysiac festivals, to be called philosophers?' EOS 'Then how are we to describe the true?' EOS You would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas, such as justice, beauty, good, evil, which are severally one, yet in their various combinations appear to be many. EOS Opinion and knowledge, then, having distinct objects, must also be distinct faculties. EOS If being is the object of knowledge, and not-being of ignorance, and these are the extremes, opinion must lie between them, and may be called darker than the one and brighter than the other. EOS Now I would ask my good friend, who denies abstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a many just, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view different--the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust? EOS Is not the double also the half, and are not heavy and light relative terms which pass into one another? EOS The first wave, the second wave, the third and greatest wave come rolling in, and we hear the roar of them. EOS All that can be said of the extravagance of Plato's proposals is anticipated by himself. EOS Nothing is more admirable than the hesitation with which he proposes the solemn text, 'Until kings are philosophers,' etc. EOS Plato is afraid of incestuous unions, but at the same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the city would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months after each hymeneal festival. EOS The common term under which, through the accidental use of language, two entirely different ideas were included was another source of confusion. EOS He may know, in this very instance, that those who make philosophy the business of their lives, generally turn out rogues if they are bad men, and fools if they are good. EOS What do you say?' EOS Conceive the captain of a ship, taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew, yet a little deaf, a little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman's art. EOS He who joins in the mutiny is termed a good pilot and what not; they have no conception that the true pilot must observe the winds and the stars, and must be their master, whether they like it or not;--such an one would be called by them fool, prater, star-gazer. EOS The philosopher should not beg of mankind to be put in authority over them. EOS Will not a young man's heart leap amid these discordant sounds? EOS Characters there may be more than human, who are exceptions--God may save a man, but not his own strength. EOS Men of this class (Critias) often become politicians--they are the authors of great mischief in states, and sometimes also of great good. EOS And thus philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors, and others enter in and dishonour her. EOS What will be the issue of such marriages? EOS Will they not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth and nature? EOS Another question is, Which of existing states is suited to her? EOS You may remember our saying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in states. EOS Let us bring her into the light of day, and make an end of the inquiry. EOS 'You are in earnest, Socrates, but the world will be equally earnest in withstanding you--no more than Thrasymachus.' EOS Do not make a quarrel between Thrasymachus and me, who were never enemies and are now good friends enough. EOS Or be jealous of one who has no jealousy? EOS When mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it? EOS 'They will be less disposed to quarrel.' EOS I gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose concerning women and children. EOS I will be wiser now and acknowledge that we must go to the bottom of another question: What is to be the education of our guardians? EOS It was agreed that they were to be lovers of their country, and were to be tested in the refiner's fire of pleasures and pains, and those who came forth pure and remained fixed in their principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after death. EOS You remember all the contradictory elements, which met in the philosopher--how difficult to find them all in a single person! EOS (Strange that we should be so precise about trifles, so careless about the highest truths!) EOS You to pretend unconsciousness, when you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know so little, and without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it! EOS According to others the good is pleasure; but then comes the absurdity that good is bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as good. EOS Ought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, of which every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything? EOS Can I say what I do not know? EOS I wish that I could, but in my present mood I cannot reach to the height of the knowledge of the good. EOS This eye of the day or sun is what I call the child of the good, standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to the intellectual. EOS 'That is a reach of thought more than human; but, pray, go on with the image, for I suspect that there is more behind.' EOS And now to those four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties--pure intelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence to the second; to the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of shadows--and the clearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the truth of the objects to which they are related...  Like Socrates, we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher. EOS In language which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and country, he is described as 'the spectator of all time and all existence.' EOS The eagerness of the pursuit has abated; there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive reflection upon nature and human life as a whole; more of exact observation and less of anticipation and inspiration. EOS Still, in the altered conditions of knowledge, the parallel is not wholly lost; and there may be a use in translating the conception of Plato into the language of our own age. EOS He is aware of the importance of 'classifying according to nature,' and will try to 'separate the limbs of science without breaking them' (Phaedr.). EOS He has a clearer conception of the divisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was possible to the ancients. EOS He brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against him by a modern logician--that he extracts the answer because he knows how to put the question. EOS In this allegory the people are distinguished from the professional politicians, and, as elsewhere, are spoken of in a tone of pity rather than of censure under the image of 'the noble captain who is not very quick in his perceptions.' EOS The world in all ages has been divided between contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and know no other weapons. EOS We too observe that there are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar delicacy of constitution; as is evidently true of the poetical and imaginative temperament, which often seems to depend on impressions, and hence can only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere. EOS He can assume the disguise of virtue or disinterestedness without having them, or veil personal enmity in the language of patriotism and philosophy,--he can say the word which all men are thinking, he has an insight which is terrible into the follies and weaknesses of his fellow-men. EOS The question is asked,--Why are the citizens of states so hostile to philosophy? EOS The answer is, that they do not know her. EOS He would probably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a system of universal knowledge, which inferred the parts from the whole rather than the whole from the parts. EOS He is hastening on to the 'end of the intellectual world' without even making a beginning of them. EOS In modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of acquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute knowledge. EOS One man will have the whole in his mind before he begins; to another the processes of mind and hand will be simultaneous. EOS 3. EOS Between the Eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena, the Pythagorean principle of number found a place, and was, as Aristotle remarks, a conducting medium from one to the other. EOS The subjective relation between them further suggested an objective one; although the passage from one to the other is really imaginary (Metaph.). EOS Probably Plato has been led by the love of analogy (Timaeus) to make four terms instead of three, although the objects perceived in both divisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense. EOS They then cease to be hypotheses or pictures, and become essential parts of a higher truth which is at once their first principle and their final cause. EOS We cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage, but we may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are common to us and to Plato: such as (1) the unity and correlation of the sciences, or rather of science, for in Plato's time they were not yet parted off or distinguished; (2) the existence of a Divine Power, or life or idea or cause or reason, not yet conceived or no longer conceived as in the Timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person; (3) the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of the mathematical sciences, and in a measure of every science when isolated from the rest; (4) the conviction of a truth which is invisible, and of a law, though hardly a law of nature, which permeates the intellectual rather than the visible world. EOS The imperfect intelligence of Glaucon, and the reluctance of Socrates to make a beginning, mark the difficulty of the subject. EOS It was the truth of all things, and also the light in which they shone forth, and became evident to intelligences human and divine. EOS It was the life as well as the light of the world, all knowledge and all power were comprehended in it. EOS The God of the Timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good; they are aspects of the same, differing only as the personal from the impersonal, or the masculine from the neuter, the one being the expression or language of mythology, the other of philosophy. EOS This, or something like this, is the meaning of the idea of good as conceived by Plato. EOS As his words are few and his manner reticent and tentative, so must the style of his interpreter be. EOS We should not approach his meaning more nearly by attempting to define it further. EOS Last of all they will conclude:--This is he who gives us the year and the seasons, and is the author of all that we see. EOS How will they rejoice in passing from darkness to light! EOS How worthless to them will seem the honours and glories of the den! EOS There is a further lesson taught by this parable of ours. EOS Did you never observe how the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes, and the more clearly he sees, the more evil he does? EOS And have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world? EOS 'Will they not think this a hardship?' EOS May we not fairly say to our philosopher,--Friend, we do you no wrong; for in other States philosophy grows wild, and a wild plant owes nothing to the gardener, but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and kings of our hive, and therefore we must insist on your descending into the den. EOS It may be that the saint or philosopher who is best fitted, may also be the least inclined to rule, but necessity is laid upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas. EOS Then now comes the question,--How shall we create our rulers; what way is there from darkness to light? EOS Including the art of war? EOS For if Agamemnon could not count his feet (and without number how could he?) EOS But I am not speaking of these practical applications of arithmetic, for number, in my view, is rather to be regarded as a conductor to thought and being. EOS And to our higher purpose no science can be better adapted; but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, not of a shopkeeper. EOS That is a small matter; the use of geometry, to which I refer, is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of the idea of good, and the compelling the mind to look at true being, and not at generation only. EOS The geometer is always talking of squaring, subtending, apposing, as if he had in view action; whereas knowledge is the real object of the study. EOS It should elevate the soul, and create the mind of philosophy; it should raise up what has fallen down, not to speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics, and in the improvement of the faculties. EOS I like your way of giving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the world. EOS Yes, I said; my hastiness has only hindered us. EOS I am an exception, then; astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw the soul not upwards, but downwards. EOS All the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a copy which falls far short of the divine Original, and teaches nothing about the absolute harmonies or motions of things. EOS There is a sister science of harmonical motion, adapted to the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other applications also. EOS For all these things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a mere mathematician is also a dialectician? EOS Even so the dialectical faculty withdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the contemplation of the idea of good, and never rests but at the very end of the intellectual world. EOS Dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above hypotheses, converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of the barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world, with the help of the sciences which we have been describing--sciences, as they are often termed, although they require some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science, and this in our previous sketch was understanding. EOS Then you must train them in dialectic, which will teach them to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of the sciences. EOS But I felt that I was. EOS The sciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be brought into relation with each other and with true being; for the power of combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical ability. EOS There seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of Plato,--first, to realize abstractions; secondly, to connect them. EOS He then seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense, not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the common use of language. EOS Still the exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the mind, and played a great part in the education of the human race. EOS Plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that it might be quickened by the study of number and relation. EOS his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical proportion in the Ethics (Book V), or between numerical and proportional equality in the Politics. EOS He will observe that Plato has a conception of geometry, in which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant and shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working geometrical problems by a more general mode of analysis. EOS He will remark with interest on the backward state of solid geometry, which, alas! EOS Still more will he be struck with the comprehensiveness of view which led Plato, at a time when these sciences hardly existed, to say that they must be studied in relation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle of truth and being. EOS The truth and certainty of numbers, when thus disengaged from phenomena, gave them a kind of sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher. EOS And those who in modern times see the world pervaded by universal law, may also see an anticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the Platonic idea of good, which is the source and measure of all things, and yet only an abstraction (Philebus). EOS First, that which relates to the analysis of vision. EOS To us, the perceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which accompanies them. EOS Whereas to Plato sense is the Heraclitean flux of sense, not the vision of objects in the order in which they actually present themselves to the experienced sight, but as they may be imagined to appear confused and blurred to the half-awakened eye of the infant. EOS The first action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this chaos, and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under which the confused impressions of sense may be arranged. EOS (Symposium.) EOS First, there have been great men who, in the language of Burke, 'have been too much given to general maxims,' who, like J.S. EOS They are full of light, but the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or blindness. EOS Men of this kind have no universal except their own interests or the interests of their class, no principle but the opinion of persons like themselves, no knowledge of affairs beyond what they pick up in the streets or at their club. EOS From familiar examples like these we may learn what Plato meant by the eyesight which is liable to two kinds of disorders. EOS They 'light upon every flower,' following their own wayward wills, or because the wind blows them. EOS They may be counted happy if in later years they retain some of the simple truths which they acquired in early education, and which they may, perhaps, find to be worth all the rest. EOS Plato is very well aware that the faculty of the mathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense which recognizes and combines first principles. EOS The quaint notion that if Palamedes was the inventor of number Agamemnon could not have counted his feet; the art by which we are made to believe that this State of ours is not a dream only; the gravity with which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the State, namely, the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of age, in order to expedite the business of education by a generation, are also truly Platonic. EOS (For the last, compare the passage at the end of the third book, in which he expects the lie about the earthborn men to be believed in the second generation.) EOS 'That is easily done,' he replied: 'You were speaking of the State which you had constructed, and of the individual who answered to this, both of whom you affirmed to be good; and you said that of inferior States there were four forms and four individuals corresponding to them, which although deficient in various degrees, were all of them worth inspecting with a view to determining the relative happiness or misery of the best or worst man. EOS This last will have to be compared with the perfectly just, which is the fifth, that we may know which is the happier, and then we shall be able to determine whether the argument of Thrasymachus or our own is the more convincing. EOS And as before we began with the State and went on to the individual, so now, beginning with timocracy, let us go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to the other forms of government, and the individuals who answer to them. EOS The new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers and contempt for trade, and having common meals, and in devotion to warlike and gymnastic exercises. EOS The leading characteristic of this State is party spirit and ambition. EOS His origin is as follows:--His father is a good man dwelling in an ill-ordered State, who has retired from politics in order that he may lead a quiet life. EOS The next form of government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor is it difficult to see how such a State arises. EOS And this evil state of society originates in bad education and bad government. EOS The lesson which he thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves politics, represses his pride, and saves pence. EOS The man is mean, saving, toiling, the slave of one passion which is the master of the rest: Is he not the very image of the State? EOS If he is the trustee of an orphan, and has the power to defraud, he will soon prove that he is not without the will, and that his passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason. EOS Next comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and the oligarchical man. EOS Thus men of family often lose their property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city, full of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for revolution. EOS Observe, too, how grandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of education,--how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! EOS Perhaps I ought to explain this latter term:--Necessary pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot do without; unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of which the desire might be eradicated by early training. EOS For example, the pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a certain point; beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind, and the excess may be avoided. EOS And the drone, as we called him, is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires, whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to the necessary. EOS Falsehoods and illusions ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into the country of the Lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. EOS Insolence they call good breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage. EOS There remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all States--tyranny and the tyrant. EOS Both arise from excess; the one from excess of wealth, the other from excess of freedom. EOS Nay, the very animals in a democratic State have a freedom which is unknown in other places. EOS Even so the protector, who tastes human blood, and slays some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands, must either perish or become a wolf--that is, a tyrant. EOS Perhaps he is driven out, but he soon comes back from exile; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means, they plot his assassination. EOS Thereupon the friend of the people makes his well-known request to them for a body-guard, which they readily grant, thinking only of his danger and not of their own. EOS And the Great Protector, having crushed all his rivals, stands proudly erect in the chariot of State, a full-blown tyrant: Let us enquire into the nature of his happiness. EOS In the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he is not a 'dominus,' no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt and the monopoly of land. EOS He is thus enabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes, and so keep them at work; and he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy. EOS The consequence is, that he has to make a purgation of the State; but, unlike the physician who purges away the bad, he must get rid of the high-spirited, the wise and the wealthy; for he has no choice between death and a life of shame and dishonour. EOS To return to the tyrant--How will he support that rare army of his? EOS And the people have jumped from the fear of slavery into slavery, out of the smoke into the fire. EOS Thus liberty, when out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of servitude... EOS Of this law the famous geometrical figure or number is the expression. EOS When good laws had been given, he thought only of the manner in which they were likely to be corrupted, or of how they might be filled up in detail or restored in accordance with their original spirit. EOS The order of constitutions which is adopted by him represents an order of thought rather than a succession of time, and may be considered as the first attempt to frame a philosophy of history. EOS The individual who answers to timocracy has some noticeable qualities. EOS But there is obviously no connection between the manner in which the timocratic State springs out of the ideal, and the mere accident by which the timocratic man is the son of a retired statesman. EOS The two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less historical foundation. EOS But such was not the necessary order of succession in States; nor, indeed, can any order be discerned in the endless fluctuation of Greek history (like the tides in the Euripus), except, perhaps, in the almost uniform tendency from monarchy to aristocracy in the earliest times. EOS Athens, Argos, Corinth, Sicyon, and nearly every State with the exception of Sparta, through a similar stage of tyranny which ended either in oligarchy or democracy. EOS There is no need to suppose that he drew from life; or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a personal acquaintance with Dionysius. EOS Of a people animated by a common spirit of liberty, rising as one man to repel the Persian host, which is the leading idea of democracy in Herodotus and Thucydides, he never seems to think. EOS At last, one monster passion takes possession of the whole nature of man--this is tyranny. EOS The hit about the tyrant being a parricide; the representation of the tyrant's life as an obscene dream; the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than the most miserable of men in Book IX; the hint to the poets that if they are the friends of tyrants there is no place for them in a constitutional State, and that they are too clever not to see the propriety of their own expulsion; the continuous image of the drones who are of two kinds, swelling at last into the monster drone having wings (Book IX),--are among Plato's happiest touches. EOS This is a puzzle almost as great as the Number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation, and though apparently known to Aristotle, is referred to by Cicero as a proverb of obscurity (Ep. EOS And some have imagined that there is no answer to the puzzle, and that Plato has been practising upon his readers. EOS (Compare Cratylus; Protag.) EOS Plato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number (Tim. EOS The explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up the number 8000. EOS Numbers are called 'like and unlike' (Greek) when the factors or the sides of the planes and cubes which they represent are or are not in the same ratio: e.g. EOS They are equivalent to 'expressible in terms having the same relation to one another,' like the series 8, 12, 18, 27, each of which numbers is in the relation of (1 and 1/2) to the preceding. EOS omitting fractions, (Greek), 'irrational,' i.e. EOS Now if we remember that the number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed, and 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared, we must admit that this number implies the numbers 3, 4, 5, to which musicians attach so much importance. EOS But though agreeing with Dr. Donaldson thus far, I see no reason for supposing, as he does, that the first or perfect number is the world, the human or imperfect number the state; nor has he given any proof that the second harmony is a cube. EOS Last of all comes the tyrannical man, about whom we have to enquire, Whence is he, and how does he live--in happiness or in misery? EOS But when a man's pulse beats temperately; and he has supped on a feast of reason and come to a knowledge of himself before going to rest, and has satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their perturbing his reason, which remains clear and luminous, and when he is free from quarrel and heat,--the visions which he has on his bed are least irregular and abnormal. EOS Truly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother! EOS Love overmasters the thoughts of his youth, and he becomes in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in sleep. EOS They realize our dream; and he who is the most of a tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest time, will be the worst of them, and being the worst of them, will also be the most miserable. EOS Assuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek, let us begin by comparing the individual and State, and ask first of all, whether the State is likely to be free or enslaved--Will there not be a little freedom and a great deal of slavery? EOS And the freedom is of the bad, and the slavery of the good; and this applies to the man as well as to the State; for his soul is full of meanness and slavery, and the better part is enslaved to the worse. EOS The tyrannical man who has the misfortune also to become a public tyrant. EOS Suppose however that one of these owners and his household is carried off by a god into a wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him--will he not be in an agony of terror?--will he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to promise them many things sore against his will? EOS And suppose the same god who carried him off were to surround him with neighbours who declare that no man ought to have slaves, and that the owners of them should be punished with death. EOS Master of others when he is not master of himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete; the meanest of slaves and the most abject of flatterers; wanting all things, and never able to satisfy his desires; always in fear and distraction, like the State of which he is the representative. EOS 'Made the proclamation yourself.' EOS Interrogate now the three natures, and each one will be found praising his own pleasures and depreciating those of others. EOS The money-maker will contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of wealth. EOS And which of the three has the truest knowledge and the widest experience? EOS When not attaining, they compel the other parts of the soul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs. EOS The tyrant is the third removed from the oligarch, and has therefore, not a shadow of his pleasure, but the shadow of a shadow only. EOS Now that we know the nature of justice and injustice, let us make an image of the soul, which will personify his words. EOS And intemperance is the letting loose of the multiform monster, and pride and sullenness are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent element, while luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great relaxation of spirit. EOS And our intention in educating the young, is to give them self-control; the law desires to nurse up in them a higher principle, and when they have acquired this, they may go their ways. EOS Or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if the concealment of evil prevents the cure? EOS 'In that case,' said he, 'he will never be a politician.' EOS Whether such a state is or ever will be matters not; he will act according to that pattern and no other... EOS 1. EOS here, or lo! EOS there, for the kingdom of God is within you.') EOS BOOK X. EOS I have loved Homer ever since I was a boy, and even now he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry. EOS He makes the Gods also. EOS Exactly so; and the painter is such a creator as you are with the mirror, and he is even more unreal than the carpenter; although neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be supposed to make the absolute bed. EOS Reflect:--Here are three beds; one in nature, which is made by God; another, which is made by the carpenter; and the third, by the painter. EOS And this, without being really different, appears to be different, and has many points of view, of which only one is caught by the painter, who represents everything because he represents a piece of everything, and that piece an image. EOS And he can paint any other artist, although he knows nothing of their arts; and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or simple people. EOS or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to Thales and Anacharsis? EOS Would he not have had many devoted followers? EOS If Protagoras and Prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can manage house or State without them, is it likely that Homer and Hesiod would have been allowed to go about as beggars--I mean if they had really been able to do the world any good?--would not men have compelled them to stay where they were, or have followed them about in order to get education? EOS Once more, the imitator has no knowledge of reality, but only of appearance. EOS The painter paints, and the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but neither understands the use of them--the knowledge of this is confined to the horseman; and so of other things. EOS The flute-player will know the good and bad flute, and the maker will put faith in him; but the imitator will neither know nor have faith--neither science nor true opinion can be ascribed to him. EOS And the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of poetry as well as painting. EOS The imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary, in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result, and present experience of pleasure and pain. EOS 'In the latter case.' EOS For when we stumble, we should not, like children, make an uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not raising a lament, but finding a cure. EOS The same is true of comedy,--you may often laugh at buffoonery which you would be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the stage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. EOS And it is not worth while to forsake justice and virtue for the attractions of poetry, any more than for the sake of honour or wealth. EOS And yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than I have described. EOS 'Surely you are not prepared to prove that?' EOS Indeed I am. EOS The soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not, by reason of them, brought any nearer to death. EOS Nothing which was not destroyed from within ever perished by external affection of evil. EOS You are quite right. EOS If sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot destroy the soul, hardly will anything else destroy her. EOS But the soul which cannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be immortal and everlasting. EOS They cannot diminish, because they cannot be destroyed; nor yet increase, for the increase of the immortal must come from something mortal, and so all would end in immortality. EOS And now you shall repay me what you borrowed; and I will enumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death. EOS And since I have shown that justice has reality, you must grant me also that she has the palm of appearance. EOS The clever rogue makes a great start at first, but breaks down before he reaches the goal, and slinks away in dishonour; whereas the true runner perseveres to the end, and receives the prize. EOS Come, then, and I will tell you the story of Er, the son of Armenius, a valiant man. EOS He was supposed to have died in battle, but ten days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home for burial. EOS Those who came from earth wept at the remembrance of their sorrows, but the spirits from above spoke of glorious sights and heavenly bliss. EOS He added something hardly worth repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were born. EOS (This Ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant, who had murdered his father, and his elder brother, a thousand years before.) EOS The ends of the column were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of Necessity, on which all the heavenly bodies turned--the hook and spindle were of adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. EOS The largest (the fixed stars) was spangled--the seventh (the sun) was brightest--the eighth (the moon) shone by the light of the seventh--the second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) were most like one another and yellower than the eighth--the third (Jupiter) had the whitest light--the fourth (Mars) was red--the sixth (Venus) was in whiteness second. EOS The whole had one motion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner circles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness and slowness. EOS There were tyrannies ending in misery and exile, and lives of men and women famous for their different qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and poverty, sickness and health. EOS 'Let not the first be careless in his choice, nor the last despair.' EOS He spoke; and when he had spoken, he who had drawn the first lot chose a tyranny: he did not see that he was fated to devour his own children--and when he discovered his mistake, he wept and beat his breast, blaming chance and the Gods and anybody rather than himself. EOS He saw the soul of Orpheus changing into a swan because he would not be born of a woman; there was Thamyras becoming a nightingale; musical birds, like the swan, choosing to be men; the twentieth soul, which was that of Ajax, preferring the life of a lion to that of a man, in remembrance of the injustice which was done to him in the judgment of the arms; and Agamemnon, from a like enmity to human nature, passing into an eagle. EOS About the middle was the soul of Atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete, and next to her Epeus taking the nature of a workwoman; among the last was Thersites, who was changing himself into a monkey. EOS Thither, the last of all, came Odysseus, and sought the lot of a private man, which lay neglected and despised, and when he found it he went away rejoicing, and said that if he had been first instead of last, his choice would have been the same. EOS Er himself was prevented from drinking. EOS The Tenth Book of the Republic of Plato falls into two divisions: first, resuming an old thread which has been interrupted, Socrates assails the poets, who, now that the nature of the soul has been analyzed, are seen to be very far gone from the truth; and secondly, having shown the reality of the happiness of the just, he demands that appearance shall be restored to him, and then proceeds to prove the immortality of the soul. EOS He is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own lifetime, and a theatrocracy, as he says in the Laws, had taken the place of an intellectual aristocracy. EOS Dramatic and lyric poetry, like every other branch of Greek literature, was falling under the power of rhetoric. EOS Nor can he have been expected to look with favour on the licence of Aristophanes, now at the end of his career, who had begun by satirizing Socrates in the Clouds, and in a similar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of ideal commonwealths in his Eccleziazusae, or Female Parliament (Laws). EOS In the Tenth Book Plato introduces a new series of objections. EOS The eye or mind which feels as well as sees can give dignity and pathos to a ruined mill, or a straw-built shed (Rembrandt), to the hull of a vessel 'going to its last home' (Turner). EOS Yet we must acknowledge that we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to them; and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own breast. EOS Every one would acknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and elevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by the peacefulness of nature. EOS He himself ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of Socrates; though, as he tells us of Solon, 'he might have been one of the greatest of them, if he had not been deterred by other pursuits' (Tim.) EOS For Plato is the prophet who 'came into the world to convince men'--first of the fallibility of sense and opinion, and secondly of the reality of abstract ideas. EOS Despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas and false teachers at its service--in the history of Modern Europe as well as of Greece and Rome. EOS The Greek tyrants were not insensible to the importance of awakening in their cause a Pseudo-Hellenic feeling; they were proud of successes at the Olympic games; they were not devoid of the love of literature and art. EOS He compares the corruption of his contemporaries with the idea of a perfect society, and gathers up into one mass of evil the evils and errors of mankind; to him they are personified in the rhetoricians, sophists, poets, rulers who deceive and govern the world. EOS But this only shows that art, like other outward things, may be turned to good and also to evil, and is not more closely connected with the higher than with the lower part of the soul. EOS Milton in his day doubted whether an epic poem was any longer possible. EOS Among ourselves the creative power seems often to be growing weaker, and scientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering to the mind than formerly. EOS The illusion of the feelings commonly called love, has hitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and romance, and has exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence on the world. EOS The fairest forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind, as is proved by the fact that the Mahometans, and many sects of Christians, have renounced the use of pictures and images. EOS And the revival or reform of religions, like the first revelation of them, has come from within and has generally disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments. EOS For nature too is a form of art; and a breath of the fresh air or a single glance at the varying landscape would in an instant revive and reillumine the extinguished spark of poetry in the human breast. EOS For we too have reason to complain that our poets and novelists 'paint inferior truth' and 'are concerned with the inferior part of the soul'; that the readers of them become what they read and are injuriously affected by them. EOS The next greatest poet of modern times, Goethe, is concerned with 'a lower degree of truth'; he paints the world as a stage on which 'all the men and women are merely players'; he cultivates life as an art, but he furnishes no ideals of truth and action. EOS The poet may rebel against any attempt to set limits to his fancy; and he may argue truly that moralizing in verse is not poetry. EOS Possibly, like Mephistopheles in Faust, he may retaliate on his adversaries. EOS Returning to Plato, we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and error appears in other parts of the argument. EOS On the other hand, his argument that Homer, if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth knowing, would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a rhapsodist, is both false and contrary to the spirit of Plato (Rep.). EOS The argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of soul and body. EOS The tale has certainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the pilgrimages of the soul in the Zend Avesta (Haug, Avesta). EOS But no trace of acquaintance with Zoroaster is found elsewhere in Plato's writings, and there is no reason for giving him the name of Er the Pamphylian. EOS The spindle (which is of adamant) is fastened to the ends of the chains which extend to the middle of the column of light--this column is said to hold together the heaven; but whether it hangs from the spindle, or is at right angles to it, is not explained. EOS But we are not certain that in the former they are moving round the earth. EOS The earth is a sort of earth and heaven in one, like the heaven of the Phaedrus, on the back of which the spectator goes out to take a peep at the stars and is borne round in the revolution. EOS The giving of the lots, the weaving of them, and the making of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three Fates--Lachesis, Clotho, Atropos, are obviously derived from their names. EOS But chance, however adverse, may be overcome by the wisdom of man, if he knows how to choose aright; there is a worse enemy to man than chance; this enemy is himself. EOS The verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand years, by the intimation that Ardiaeus had lived a thousand years before; the coincidence of Er coming to life on the twelfth day after he was supposed to have been dead with the seven days which the pilgrims passed in the meadow, and the four days during which they journeyed to the column of light; the precision with which the soul is mentioned who chose the twentieth lot; the passing remarks that there was no definite character among the souls, and that the souls which had chosen ill blamed any one rather than themselves; or that some of the souls drank more than was necessary of the waters of Forgetfulness, while Er himself was hindered from drinking; the desire of Odysseus to rest at last, unlike the conception of him in Dante and Tennyson; the feigned ignorance of how Er returned to the body, when the other souls went shooting like stars to their birth,--add greatly to the probability of the narrative. EOS Of all the works of Plato the Symposium is the most perfect in form, and may be truly thought to contain more than any commentator has ever dreamed of; or, as Goethe said of one of his own writings, more than the author himself knew. EOS The genius of Greek art seems to triumph over the traditions of Pythagorean, Eleatic, or Megarian systems, and 'the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy' has at least a superficial reconcilement. EOS He had imagined that the discourses were recent. EOS There he is mistaken: but they are still fresh in the memory of his informant, who had just been repeating them to Glaucon, and is quite prepared to have another rehearsal of them in a walk from the Piraeus to Athens. EOS But Orpheus, the miserable harper, who went down to Hades alive, that he might bring back his wife, was mocked with an apparition only, and the gods afterwards contrived his death as the punishment of his cowardliness. EOS Pausanias, who was sitting next, then takes up the tale:--He says that Phaedrus should have distinguished the heavenly love from the earthly, before he praised either. EOS The first of the two loves has a noble purpose, and delights only in the intelligent nature of man, and is faithful to the end, and has no shadow of wantonness or lust. EOS The second is the coarser kind of love, which is a love of the body rather than of the soul, and is of women and boys as well as of men. EOS Some, like the Boeotians, approve of them; others, like the Ionians, and most of the barbarians, disapprove of them; partly because they are aware of the political dangers which ensue from them, as may be seen in the instance of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. EOS Eryximachus is ready to do both, and after prescribing for the hiccough, speaks as follows:--  He agrees with Pausanias in maintaining that there are two kinds of love; but his art has led him to the further conclusion that the empire of this double love extends over all things, and is to be found in animals and plants as well as in man. EOS Then the old tale has to be repeated of fair Urania and the coarse Polyhymnia, who must be indulged sparingly, just as in my own art of medicine care must be taken that the taste of the epicure be gratified without inflicting upon him the attendant penalty of disease. EOS Such is the power of love; and that love which is just and temperate has the greatest power, and is the source of all our happiness and friendship with the gods and with one another. EOS Let us cut them in two, he said; then they will only have half their strength, and we shall have twice as many sacrifices. EOS For love is the desire of the whole, and the pursuit of the whole is called love. EOS ), for my words refer to all mankind everywhere. EOS Agathon's speech follows:--  He will speak of the god first and then of his gifts: He is the fairest and blessedest and best of the gods, and also the youngest, having had no existence in the old days of Iapetus and Cronos when the gods were at war. EOS The things that were done then were done of necessity and not of love. EOS Also he is courageous, for he is the conqueror of the lord of war. EOS He begins by remarking satirically that he has not understood the terms of the original agreement, for he fancied that they meant to speak the true praises of love, but now he finds that they only say what is good of him, whether true or false. EOS To this Diotima replies that he is the son of Plenty and Poverty, and partakes of the nature of both, and is full and starved by turns. EOS Further, he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge:--in this he resembles the philosopher who is also in a mean between the wise and the ignorant. EOS For the beautiful let us substitute the good, and we have no difficulty in seeing the possession of the good to be happiness, and Love to be the desire of happiness, although the meaning of the word has been too often confined to one kind of love. EOS Why then is there all this flutter and excitement about love? EOS Because all men and women at a certain age are desirous of bringing to the birth. EOS Even in the same individual there is a perpetual succession as well of the parts of the material body as of the thoughts and desires of the mind; nay, even knowledge comes and goes. EOS He is placed on a couch at his side, but suddenly, on recognizing Socrates, he starts up, and a sort of conflict is carried on between them, which Agathon is requested to appease. EOS Socrates at one time seemed about to fall in love with him; and he thought that he would thereby gain a wonderful opportunity of receiving lessons of wisdom. EOS He has suffered agonies from him, and is at his wit's end. EOS When Alcibiades has done speaking, a dispute begins between him and Agathon and Socrates. EOS When he wakes at cockcrow the revellers are nearly all asleep. EOS Only Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon hold out; they are drinking from a large goblet, which they pass round, and Socrates is explaining to the two others, who are half-asleep, that the genius of tragedy is the same as that of comedy, and that the writer of tragedy ought to be a writer of comedy also. EOS The Symposium of Plato is a work of this character, and can with difficulty be rendered in any words but the writer's own. EOS The expression 'poema magis putandum quam comicorum poetarum,' which has been applied to all the writings of Plato, is especially applicable to the Symposium. EOS (Aesch. EOS Frag. EOS But Plato seems also to be aware that there is a mystery of love in man as well as in nature, extending beyond the mere immediate relation of the sexes. EOS He is conscious that the highest and noblest things in the world are not easily severed from the sensual desires, or may even be regarded as a spiritualized form of them. EOS We may observe that Socrates himself is not represented as originally unimpassioned, but as one who has overcome his passions; the secret of his power over others partly lies in his passionate but self-controlled nature. EOS In the Phaedrus and Symposium love is not merely the feeling usually so called, but the mystical contemplation of the beautiful and the good. EOS This abstraction is the far-off heaven on which the eye of the mind is fixed in fond amazement. EOS They are fanciful, partly facetious performances, 'yet also having a certain measure of seriousness,' which the successive speakers dedicate to the god. EOS That confusion begins in the concrete, was the natural feeling of a mind dwelling in the world of ideas. EOS ; and compare Sympos. EOS with Phaedr.). EOS But these and similar distinctions are not found in Plato;--they are the points of view of his critics, and seem to impede rather than to assist us in understanding him. EOS But he soon passes on to more common-place topics. EOS The love of women is regarded by him as almost on an equality with that of men; and he makes the singular remark that the gods favour the return of love which is made by the beloved more than the original sentiment, because the lover is of a nobler and diviner nature. EOS The value which he attributes to such loves as motives to virtue and philosophy is at variance with modern and Christian notions, but is in accordance with Hellenic sentiment. EOS The opinion of Christendom has not altogether condemned passionate friendships between persons of the same sex, but has certainly not encouraged them, because though innocent in themselves in a few temperaments they are liable to degenerate into fearful evil. EOS His speech is 'more words than matter,' and might have been composed by a pupil of Lysias or of Prodicus, although there is no hint given that Plato is specially referring to them. EOS To Eryximachus Love is the good physician; he sees everything as an intelligent physicist, and, like many professors of his art in modern times, attempts to reduce the moral to the physical; or recognises one law of love which pervades them both. EOS His account of the origin of the sexes has the greatest (comic) probability and verisimilitude. EOS The rhetoric of Agathon elevates the soul to 'sunlit heights,' but at the same time contrasts with the natural and necessary eloquence of Socrates. EOS As it would be out of character for Socrates to make a lengthened harangue, the speech takes the form of a dialogue between Socrates and a mysterious woman of foreign extraction. EOS She elicits the final truth from one who knows nothing, and who, speaking by the lips of another, and himself a despiser of rhetoric, is proved also to be the most consummate of rhetoricians (compare Menexenus). EOS The last of the six discourses begins with a short argument which overthrows not only Agathon but all the preceding speakers by the help of a distinction which has escaped them. EOS Extravagant praises have been ascribed to Love as the author of every good; no sort of encomium was too high for him, whether deserved and true or not. EOS But Socrates has no talent for speaking anything but the truth, and if he is to speak the truth of Love he must honestly confess that he is not a good at all: for love is of the good, and no man can desire that which he has. EOS For he who has beauty or good may desire more of them; and he who has beauty or good in himself may desire beauty and good in others. EOS She has taught him that love is another aspect of philosophy. EOS Here is the beginning of Neoplatonism, or rather, perhaps, a proof (of which there are many) that the so-called mysticism of the East was not strange to the Greek of the fifth century before Christ. EOS In both the lover of wisdom is the 'spectator of all time and of all existence.' EOS The description of Socrates follows immediately after the speech of Socrates; one is the complement of the other. EOS Such an union is not wholly untrue to human nature, which is capable of combining good and evil in a degree beyond what we can easily conceive. EOS He is contented with representing him as a saint, who has won 'the Olympian victory' over the temptations of human nature. EOS We are still more surprised to find that the philosopher is incited to take the first step in his upward progress (Symp.) EOS But the love of youth when not depraved was a love of virtue and modesty as well as of beauty, the one being the expression of the other; and in certain Greek states, especially at Sparta and Thebes, the honourable attachment of a youth to an elder man was a part of his education. EOS ), is not a mere fiction of Plato's, but seems actually to have existed at Thebes in the days of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, if we may believe writers cited anonymously by Plutarch, Pelop. EOS But owing partly to the puzzling nature of the subject these friendships are spoken of by Plato in a manner different from that customary among ourselves. EOS The existence of such attachments may be reasonably attributed to the inferiority and seclusion of woman, and the want of a real family or social life and parental influence in Hellenic cities; and they were encouraged by the practice of gymnastic exercises, by the meetings of political clubs, and by the tie of military companionship. EOS It is not likely that a Greek parent committed him to a lover, any more than we should to a schoolmaster, in the expectation that he would be corrupted by him, but rather in the hope that his morals would be better cared for than was possible in a great household of slaves. EOS in the Symposium) half in jest, yet 'with a certain degree of seriousness.' EOS Indecency was an element of the ludicrous in the old Greek Comedy, as it has been in other ages and countries. EOS They seem to have been no longer tolerated by the greater refinement of the age. EOS Some general considerations occur to our mind when we begin to reflect on this subject. EOS No charge is more easily set going than the imputation of secret wickedness (which cannot be either proved or disproved and often cannot be defined) when directed against a person of whom the world, or a section of it, is predisposed to think evil. EOS (4) We observe that at Thebes and Lacedemon the attachment of an elder friend to a beloved youth was often deemed to be a part of his education; and was encouraged by his parents--it was only shameful if it degenerated into licentiousness. EOS ; Athenaeus on the authority of Theopompus). EOS We must not suspect evil in the hearty kiss or embrace of a male friend 'returning from the army at Potidaea' any more than in a similar salutation when practised by members of the same family. EOS (Compare Hoeck's Creta and the admirable and exhaustive article of Meier in Ersch and Grueber's Cyclopedia on this subject; Plutarch, Amatores; Athenaeus; Lysias contra Simonem; Aesch. EOS c. EOS 384, which is the forty-fourth year of Plato's life. EOS Then follows, in the language of the mysteries, a higher and a higher degree of initiation; at last we arrive at the perfect vision of beauty, not relative or changing, but eternal and absolute; not bounded by this world, or in or out of this world, but an aspect of the divine, extending over all things, and having no limit of space or time: this is the highest knowledge of which the human mind is capable. EOS That the soul has such a reach of thought, and is capable of partaking of the eternal nature, seems to imply that she too is eternal (compare Phaedrus). EOS But Plato does not distinguish the eternal in man from the eternal in the world or in God. EOS The Symposium of Xenophon, in which Socrates describes himself as a pander, and also discourses of the difference between sensual and sentimental love, likewise offers several interesting points of comparison. EOS The Symposium of Xenophon, if written by him at all, would certainly show that he wrote against Plato, and was acquainted with his works. EOS The (so-called) Symposium of Xenophon may therefore have no more title to be regarded as genuine than the confessedly spurious Apology. EOS Concerning the things about which you ask to be informed I believe that I am not ill-prepared with an answer. EOS man, halt! EOS Your informant, Glaucon, I said, must have been very indistinct indeed, if you imagine that the occasion was recent; or that I could have been of the party. EOS Then it must have been a long while ago, he said; and who told you--did Socrates? EOS Then, said Glaucon, let us have the tale over again; is not the road to Athens just made for conversation? EOS For to speak or to hear others speak of philosophy always gives me the greatest pleasure, to say nothing of the profit. EOS But when I hear another strain, especially that of you rich men and traders, such conversation displeases me; and I pity you who are my companions, because you think that you are doing something when in reality you are doing nothing. EOS COMPANION: No more of that, Apollodorus; but let me renew my request that you would repeat the conversation. EOS I will do as you bid me, I replied. EOS For, after picturing Agamemnon as the most valiant of men, he makes Menelaus, who is but a fainthearted warrior, come unbidden (Iliad) to the banquet of Agamemnon, who is feasting and offering sacrifices, not the better to the worse, but the worse to the better. EOS But I shall say that I was bidden of you, and then you will have to make an excuse. EOS Socrates dropped behind in a fit of abstraction, and desired Aristodemus, who was waiting, to go on before him. EOS When he reached the house of Agathon he found the doors wide open, and a comical thing happened. EOS A servant coming out met him, and led him at once into the banqueting-hall in which the guests were reclining, for the banquet was about to begin. EOS You were quite right in coming, said Agathon; but where is he himself? EOS Serve up whatever you please, for there is no one to give you orders; hitherto I have never left you to yourselves. EOS I think that you are right, said Eryximachus, the son of Acumenus; but I should still like to hear one other person speak: Is Agathon able to drink hard? EOS This proposal having been accepted, Eryximachus proceeded as follows:--  I will begin, he said, after the manner of Melanippe in Euripides,  'Not mine the word'  which I am about to speak, but that of Phaedrus. EOS For often he says to me in an indignant tone:--'What a strange thing it is, Eryximachus, that, whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in their honour, the great and glorious god, Love, has no encomiast among all the poets who are so many. EOS So entirely has this great deity been neglected.' EOS The proposal, as I am aware, may seem rather hard upon us whose place is last; but we shall be contented if we hear some good speeches first. EOS Phaedrus began by affirming that Love is a mighty god, and wonderful among gods and men, but especially wonderful in his birth. EOS In other words, after Chaos, the Earth and Love, these two, came into being. EOS And not only is he the eldest, he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us. EOS For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than a virtuous lover, or to the lover than a beloved youth. EOS And I say that a lover who is detected in doing any dishonourable act, or submitting through cowardice when any dishonour is done to him by another, will be more pained at being detected by his beloved than at being seen by his father, or by his companions, or by any one else. EOS The beloved too, when he is found in any disgraceful situation, has the same feeling about his lover. EOS The veriest coward would become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time; Love would inspire him. EOS Now Achilles was quite aware, for he had been told by his mother, that he might avoid death and return home, and live to a good old age, if he abstained from slaying Hector. EOS He may pray, and entreat, and supplicate, and swear, and lie on a mat at the door, and endure a slavery worse than that of any slave--in any other case friends and enemies would be equally ready to prevent him, but now there is no friend who will be ashamed of him and admonish him, and no enemy will charge him with meanness or flattery; the actions of a lover have a grace which ennobles them; and custom has decided that they are highly commendable and that there no loss of character in them; and, what is strangest of all, he only may swear and forswear himself (so men say), and the gods will forgive his transgression, for there is no such thing as a lover's oath. EOS Nor when love is of this disinterested sort is there any disgrace in being deceived, but in every other case there is equal disgrace in being or not being deceived. EOS For he has proved that for his part he will do anything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement, than which there can be nothing nobler. EOS Eryximachus, he said, you ought either to stop my hiccough, or to speak in my turn until I have left off. EOS And from medicine I will begin that I may do honour to my art. EOS There are in the human body these two kinds of love, which are confessedly different and unlike, and being unlike, they have loves and desires which are unlike; and the desire of the healthy is one, and the desire of the diseased is another; and as Pausanias was just now saying that to indulge good men is honourable, and bad men dishonourable:--so too in the body the good and healthy elements are to be indulged, and the bad elements and the elements of disease are not to be indulged, but discouraged. EOS Any one who pays the least attention to the subject will also perceive that in music there is the same reconciliation of opposites; and I suppose that this must have been the meaning of Heracleitus, although his words are not accurate; for he says that The One is united by disunion, like the harmony of the bow and the lyre. EOS Then the old tale has to be repeated of fair and heavenly love--the love of Urania the fair and heavenly muse, and of the duty of accepting the temperate, and those who are as yet intemperate only that they may become temperate, and of preserving their love; and again, of the vulgar Polyhymnia, who must be used with circumspection that the pleasure be enjoyed, but may not generate licentiousness; just as in my own art it is a great matter so to regulate the desires of the epicure that he may gratify his tastes without the attendant evil of disease. EOS For all manner of impiety is likely to ensue if, instead of accepting and honouring and reverencing the harmonious love in all his actions, a man honours the other love, whether in his feelings towards gods or parents, towards the living or the dead. EOS Eryximachus said: Beware, friend Aristophanes, although you are going to speak, you are making fun of me; and I shall have to watch and see whether I cannot have a laugh at your expense, when you might speak in peace. EOS You are right, said Aristophanes, laughing. EOS Well, perhaps if you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be called to account, I may be induced to let you off. EOS The sexes were not two as they are now, but originally three in number; there was man, woman, and the union of the two, having a name corresponding to this double nature, which had once a real existence, but is now lost, and the word 'Androgynous' is only preserved as a term of reproach. EOS Now the sexes were three, and such as I have described them; because the sun, moon, and earth are three; and the man was originally the child of the sun, the woman of the earth, and the man-woman of the moon, which is made up of sun and earth, and they were all round and moved round and round like their parents. EOS Terrible was their might and strength, and the thoughts of their hearts were great, and they made an attack upon the gods; of them is told the tale of Otys and Ephialtes who, as Homer says, dared to scale heaven, and would have laid hands upon the gods. EOS Should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts, as they had done the giants, then there would be an end of the sacrifices and worship which men offered to them; but, on the other hand, the gods could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained. EOS Men who are a section of that double nature which was once called Androgynous are lovers of women; adulterers are generally of this breed, and also adulterous women who lust after men: the women who are a section of the woman do not care for men, but have female attachments; the female companions are of this sort. EOS When they reach manhood they are lovers of youth, and are not naturally inclined to marry or beget children,--if at all, they do so only in obedience to the law; but they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with one another unwedded; and such a nature is prone to love and ready to return love, always embracing that which is akin to him. EOS For the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment. EOS Suppose Hephaestus, with his instruments, to come to the pair who are lying side by side and to say to them, 'What do you people want of one another?' EOS they would be unable to explain. EOS Pol.). EOS Pol.). EOS You want to cast a spell over me, Socrates, said Agathon, in the hope that I may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the audience that I shall speak well. EOS Here Phaedrus interrupted them, saying: not answer him, my dear Agathon; for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk, especially a good-looking one, he will no longer care about the completion of our plan. EOS When you and he have paid your tribute to the god, then you may talk. EOS Let me say first how I ought to speak, and then speak:--  The previous speakers, instead of praising the god Love, or unfolding his nature, appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits which he confers upon them. EOS May I say without impiety or offence, that of all the blessed gods he is the most blessed because he is the fairest and best? EOS The ancient doings among the gods of which Hesiod and Parmenides spoke, if the tradition of them be true, were done of Necessity and not of Love; had Love been in those days, there would have been no chaining or mutilation of the gods, or other violence, but peace and sweetness, as there is now in heaven, since the rule of Love began. EOS Love is young and also tender; he ought to have a poet like Homer to describe his tenderness, as Homer says of Ate, that she is a goddess and tender:--  'Her feet are tender, for she sets her steps, Not on the ground but on the heads of men:'  herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness,--that she walks not upon the hard but upon the soft. EOS Of a truth he is the tenderest as well as the youngest, and also he is of flexile form; for if he were hard and without flexure he could not enfold all things, or wind his way into and out of every soul of man undiscovered. EOS Of his virtue I have now to speak: his greatest glory is that he can neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man; for he suffers not by force if he suffers; force comes not near him, neither when he acts does he act by force. EOS As to courage, even the God of War is no match for him; he is the captive and Love is the lord, for love, the love of Aphrodite, masters him, as the tale runs; and the master is stronger than the servant. EOS And at the touch of him every one becomes a poet, even though he had no music in him before (A fragment of the Sthenoaoea of Euripides. EOS Are they not all the works of his wisdom, born and begotten of him? EOS The arts of medicine and archery and divination were discovered by Apollo, under the guidance of love and desire; so that he too is a disciple of Love. EOS In the days of old, as I began by saying, dreadful deeds were done among the gods, for they were ruled by Necessity; but now since the birth of Love, and from the Love of the beautiful, has sprung every good in heaven and earth. EOS Therefore, Phaedrus, I say of Love that he is the fairest and best in himself, and the cause of what is fairest and best in all other things. EOS Such is the speech, Phaedrus, half-playful, yet having a certain measure of seriousness, which, according to my ability, I dedicate to the god. EOS For I was reminded of Gorgias, and at the end of his speech I fancied that Agathon was shaking at me the Gorginian or Gorgonian head of the great master of rhetoric, which was simply to turn me and my speech into stone, as Homer says (Odyssey), and strike me dumb. EOS For in my simplicity I imagined that the topics of praise should be true, and that this being presupposed, out of the true the speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in the best manner. EOS Aristodemus said that Phaedrus and the company bid him speak in any manner which he thought best. EOS Would he who is great, desire to be great, or he who is strong, desire to be strong? EOS For he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is? EOS Then, said Socrates, he desires that what he has at present may be preserved to him in the future, which is equivalent to saying that he desires something which is non-existent to him, and which as yet he has not got:  Very true, he said. EOS Then now, said Socrates, let us recapitulate the argument. EOS First, is not love of something, and of something too which is wanting to a man? EOS He assented. EOS Certainly, he replied. EOS Then would you still say that love is beautiful? EOS She was my instructress in the art of love, and I shall repeat to you what she said to me, beginning with the admissions made by Agathon, which are nearly if not quite the same which I made to the wise woman when she questioned me: I think that this will be the easiest way, and I shall take both parts myself as well as I can (compare Gorgias). EOS As you, Agathon, suggested (supra), I must speak first of the being and nature of Love, and then of his works. EOS 'What do you mean, Diotima,' I said, 'is love then evil and foul?' EOS nor again, ignorance, for neither can ignorance attain the truth), but is clearly something which is a mean between ignorance and wisdom.' EOS 'Quite true,' I replied. EOS 'How can that be?' EOS 'It is quite intelligible,' she replied; 'for you yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair--of course you would--would you dare to say that any god was not?' EOS 'Certainly not,' I replied. EOS 'And what,' I said, 'is his power?' EOS 'He interprets,' she replied, 'between gods and men, conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them, and therefore in him all is bound together, and through him the arts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all prophecy and incantation, find their way. EOS 'The tale,' she said, 'will take time; nevertheless I will tell you. EOS On the birthday of Aphrodite there was a feast of the gods, at which the god Poros or Plenty, who is the son of Metis or Discretion, was one of the guests. EOS When the feast was over, Penia or Poverty, as the manner is on such occasions, came about the doors to beg. EOS 'Still,' she said, 'the answer suggests a further question: What is given by the possession of beauty?' EOS 'Then,' she said, 'let me put the word "good" in the place of the beautiful, and repeat the question once more: If he who loves loves the good, what is it then that he loves?' EOS 'The possession of the good,' I said. EOS 'Happiness,' I replied; 'there is less difficulty in answering that question.' EOS 'You are right.' EOS I said. EOS 'Why, then,' she rejoined, 'are not all men, Socrates, said to love, but only some of them? EOS whereas you say that all men are always loving the same things.' EOS 'Give an illustration,' I said. EOS 'Still,' she said, 'you know that they are not called poets, but have other names; only that portion of the art which is separated off from the rest, and is concerned with music and metre, is termed poetry, and they who possess poetry in this sense of the word are called poets.' EOS 'Very true,' I said. EOS For you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only the great and subtle power of love; but they who are drawn towards him by any other path, whether the path of money-making or gymnastics or philosophy, are not called lovers--the name of the whole is appropriated to those whose affection takes one form only--they alone are said to love, or to be lovers.' EOS And they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away, if they are evil; for they love not what is their own, unless perchance there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good, and what belongs to another the evil. EOS 'Then,' she said, 'the simple truth is, that men love the good.' EOS 'Nay, Diotima,' I replied, 'if I had known, I should not have wondered at your wisdom, neither should I have come to learn from you about this very matter.' EOS 'I will make my meaning clearer,' she replied. EOS 'I mean to say, that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls. EOS There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation--procreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man and woman, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious they can never be. EOS But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine, and the beautiful harmonious. EOS Beauty, then, is the destiny or goddess of parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign, and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, and not without a pang refrains from conception. EOS 'Because to the mortal creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality,' she replied; 'and if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore love is of immortality.' EOS All this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love. EOS She said to me: 'And do you expect ever to become a master in the art of love, if you do not know this?' EOS Do you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your own Codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among us, would be immortal? EOS 'Those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women and beget children--this is the character of their love; their offspring, as they hope, will preserve their memory and giving them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future. EOS Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other great poets, would not rather have their children than ordinary human ones? EOS Who would not emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? EOS Would that be an ignoble life?' EOS Such, Phaedrus--and I speak not only to you, but to all of you--were the words of Diotima; and I am persuaded of their truth. EOS And being persuaded of them, I try to persuade others, that in the attainment of this end human nature will not easily find a helper better than love: And therefore, also, I say that every man ought to honour him as I myself honour him, and walk in his ways, and exhort others to do the same, and praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of my ability now and ever. EOS Lead me to Agathon,' and at length, supported by the flute-girl and some of his attendants, he found his way to them. EOS For I was unable to come yesterday, and therefore I am here to-day, carrying on my head these ribands, that taking them from my own head, I may crown the head of this fairest and wisest of men, as I may be allowed to call him. EOS But first tell me; if I come in shall we have the understanding of which I spoke (supra Will you have a very drunken man? EOS Will you drink with me or not?' EOS Take off his sandals, said Agathon, and let him make a third on the same couch. EOS Since I became his admirer I have never been allowed to speak to any other fair one, or so much as to look at them. EOS If I do, he goes wild with envy and jealousy, and not only abuses me but can hardly keep his hands off me, and at this moment he may do me some harm. EOS Please to see to this, and either reconcile me to him, or, if he attempts violence, protect me, as I am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts. EOS Observe, my friends, said Alcibiades, that this ingenious trick of mine will have no effect on Socrates, for he can drink any quantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk. EOS Eryximachus said: What is this, Alcibiades? EOS That I leave to you, said Alcibiades. EOS 'The wise physician skilled our wounds to heal (from Pope's Homer, Il.)' EOS shall prescribe and we will obey. EOS What do you want? EOS What do you think, Eryximachus? EOS What are you about? EOS I not only permit, but exhort you to speak the truth. EOS Then I will begin at once, said Alcibiades, and if I say anything which is not true, you may interrupt me if you will, and say 'that is a lie,' though my intention is to speak the truth. EOS But you must not wonder if I speak any how as things come into my mind; for the fluent and orderly enumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to a man in my condition. EOS I say, that he is exactly like the busts of Silenus, which are set up in the statuaries' shops, holding pipes and flutes in their mouths; and they are made to open in the middle, and have images of gods inside them. EOS You yourself will not deny, Socrates, that your face is like that of a satyr. EOS And he is the only person who ever made me ashamed, which you might think not to be in my nature, and there is no one else who does the same. EOS Is he not like a Silenus in this? EOS Know you that beauty and wealth and honour, at which the many wonder, are of no account with him, and are utterly despised by him: he regards not at all the persons who are gifted with them; mankind are nothing to him; all his life is spent in mocking and flouting at them. EOS But when I opened him, and looked within at his serious purpose, I saw in him divine and golden images of such fascinating beauty that I was ready to do in a moment whatever Socrates commanded: they may have escaped the observation of others, but I saw them. EOS Now I fancied that he was seriously enamoured of my beauty, and I thought that I should therefore have a grand opportunity of hearing him tell what he knew, for I had a wonderful opinion of the attractions of my youth. EOS Well, he and I were alone together, and I thought that when there was nobody with us, I should hear him speak the language which lovers use to their loves when they are by themselves, and I was delighted. EOS Nothing of the sort; he conversed as usual, and spent the day with me and then went away. EOS Afterwards I challenged him to the palaestra; and he wrestled and closed with me several times when there was no one present; I fancied that I might succeed in this manner. EOS He was not easily persuaded to come; he did, however, after a while accept the invitation, and when he came the first time, he wanted to go away at once as soon as supper was over, and I had not the face to detain him. EOS Yet as the proverb says, 'In vino veritas,' whether with boys, or without them (In allusion to two proverbs. EOS ); and therefore I must speak. EOS Nor, again, should I be justified in concealing the lofty actions of Socrates when I come to praise him. EOS So I gave him a shake, and I said: 'Socrates, are you asleep?' EOS 'No,' he said. EOS 'I think,' I replied, 'that of all the lovers whom I have ever had you are the only one who is worthy of me, and you appear to be too modest to speak. EOS And I should certainly have more reason to be ashamed of what wise men would say if I were to refuse a favour to such as you, than of what the world, who are mostly fools, would say of me if I granted it.' EOS But look again, sweet friend, and see whether you are not deceived in me. EOS The mind begins to grow critical when the bodily eye fails, and it will be a long time before you get old.' EOS Whereupon, I fancied that he was smitten, and that the words which I had uttered like arrows had wounded him, and so without waiting to hear more I got up, and throwing my coat about him crept under his threadbare cloak, as the time of year was winter, and there I lay during the whole night having this wonderful monster in my arms. EOS And yet, notwithstanding all, he was so superior to my solicitations, so contemptuous and derisive and disdainful of my beauty--which really, as I fancied, had some attractions--hear, O judges; for judges you shall be of the haughty virtue of Socrates--nothing more happened, but in the morning when I awoke (let all the gods and goddesses be my witnesses) I arose as from the couch of a father or an elder brother. EOS All this happened before he and I went on the expedition to Potidaea; there we messed together, and I had the opportunity of observing his extraordinary power of sustaining fatigue. EOS Yet at a festival he was the only person who had any real powers of enjoyment; though not willing to drink, he could if compelled beat us all at that,--wonderful to relate! EOS no human being had ever seen Socrates drunk; and his powers, if I am not mistaken, will be tested before long. EOS His fortitude in enduring cold was also surprising. EOS I will also tell, if you please--and indeed I am bound to tell--of his courage in battle; for who but he saved my life? EOS Now this was the engagement in which I received the prize of valour: for I was wounded and he would not leave me, but he rescued me and my arms; and he ought to have received the prize of valour which the generals wanted to confer on me partly on account of my rank, and I told them so, (this, again, Socrates will not impeach or deny), but he was more eager than the generals that I and not he should have the prize. EOS There was another occasion on which his behaviour was very remarkable--in the flight of the army after the battle of Delium, where he served among the heavy-armed,--I had a better opportunity of seeing him than at Potidaea, for I was myself on horseback, and therefore comparatively out of danger. EOS Clouds), just as he is in the streets of Athens, stalking like a pelican, and rolling his eyes, calmly contemplating enemies as well as friends, and making very intelligible to anybody, even from a distance, that whoever attacked him would be likely to meet with a stout resistance; and in this way he and his companion escaped--for this is the sort of man who is never touched in war; those only are pursued who are running away headlong. EOS I particularly observed how superior he was to Laches in presence of mind. EOS Many are the marvels which I might narrate in praise of Socrates; most of his ways might perhaps be paralleled in another man, but his absolute unlikeness to any human being that is or ever has been is perfectly astonishing. EOS You may imagine Brasidas and others to have been like Achilles; or you may imagine Nestor and Antenor to have been like Pericles; and the same may be said of other famous men, but of this strange being you will never be able to find any likeness, however remote, either among men who now are or who ever have been--other than that which I have already suggested of Silenus and the satyrs; and they represent in a figure not only himself, but his words. EOS I have added my blame of him for his ill-treatment of me; and he has ill-treated not only me, but Charmides the son of Glaucon, and Euthydemus the son of Diocles, and many others in the same way--beginning as their lover he has ended by making them pay their addresses to him. EOS Wherefore I say to you, Agathon, 'Be not deceived by him; learn from me and take warning, and do not be a fool and learn by experience, as the proverb says.' EOS When Alcibiades had finished, there was a laugh at his outspokenness; for he seemed to be still in love with Socrates. EOS You are sober, Alcibiades, said Socrates, or you would never have gone so far about to hide the purpose of your satyr's praises, for all this long story is only an ingenious circumlocution, of which the point comes in by the way at the end; you want to get up a quarrel between me and Agathon, and your notion is that I ought to love you and nobody else, and that you and you only ought to love Agathon. EOS I do beseech you, allow Agathon to lie between us. EOS Hurrah! EOS cried Agathon, I will rise instantly, that I may be praised by Socrates. EOS Aristodemus said that Eryximachus, Phaedrus, and others went away--he himself fell asleep, and as the nights were long took a good rest: he was awakened towards daybreak by a crowing of cocks, and when he awoke, the others were either asleep, or had gone away; there remained only Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon, who were drinking out of a large goblet which they passed round, and Socrates was discoursing to them. EOS Aristodemus was only half awake, and he did not hear the beginning of the discourse; the chief thing which he remembered was Socrates compelling the other two to acknowledge that the genius of comedy was the same with that of tragedy, and that the true artist in tragedy was an artist in comedy also. EOS To this they were constrained to assent, being drowsy, and not quite following the argument. EOS And first of all Aristophanes dropped off, then, when the day was already dawning, Agathon. EOS At the Lyceum he took a bath, and passed the day as usual. EOS
