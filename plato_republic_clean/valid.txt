there are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the sophist; the politicus or statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the state are more clearly drawn out in the laws; as works of art, the symposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence. EOS the sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of socrates and plato. EOS 698 ff. EOS the two philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and probably some elements of plato remain still undetected in aristotle. EOS like dante or bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early church he exercised a real influence on theology, and at the revival of literature on politics. EOS and many of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been anticipated in a dream by him. EOS poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and homer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along with them. EOS sir g.c. EOS lewis in the classical museum, vol. EOS the natural divisions are five in number;--(1) book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraph beginning, 'i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus,' which is introductory; the first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier dialogues, without arriving at any definite result. EOS in all attempts to determine the chronological order of the platonic writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be admitted to affect longer works, such as the republic and the laws, more than shorter ones. EOS the second title, 'concerning justice,' is not the one by which the republic is quoted, either by aristotle or generally in antiquity, and, like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues, may therefore be assumed to be of later date. EOS to plato himself, the enquiry 'what was the intention of the writer,' or 'what was the principal argument of the republic' would have been hardly intelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed (cp. EOS for the practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bear the greatest 'marks of design'--justice more than the external frame-work of the state, the idea of good more than justice. EOS it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has been raised by boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the conversation was held (the year 411 b.c. EOS yet this may be a question having no answer 'which is still worth asking,' because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato; it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological difficulties, such, for example, as the conjecture of c.f. EOS cephalus appears in the introduction only, polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument, and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book. EOS among the company are lysias (the orator) and euthydemus, the sons of cephalus and brothers of polemarchus, an unknown charmantides--these are mute auditors; also there is cleitophon, who once interrupts, where, as in the dialogue which bears his name, he appears as the friend and ally of thrasymachus. EOS the respectful attention shown to him by socrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission imposed upon him by the oracle, leads him to ask questions of all men, young and old alike, should also be noted. EOS like cephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than principles; and he quotes simonides (cp. EOS clouds) as his father had quoted pindar. EOS the pompous and empty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him. EOS nothing is more amusing than his complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten. EOS at first he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent good-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two occasional remarks. EOS ), 'thou wast ever bold in battle,' seems to show that the description of him is not devoid of verisimilitude. EOS he is full of quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out to the light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not lose faith in the just and true. EOS glaucon is more demonstrative, and generally opens the game. EOS in the discussion about religion and mythology, adeimantus is the respondent, but glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end of the book. EOS xen. EOS but any one can see that this is a mere form, of which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances. EOS the composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of the soul. EOS leaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the republic, and then proceed to consider (1) the general aspects of this hellenic ideal of the state, (2) the modern lights in which the thoughts of plato may be read. EOS the manner in which the conversation has arisen is described as follows:--socrates and his companion glaucon are about to leave the festival when they are detained by a message from polemarchus, who speedily appears accompanied by adeimantus, the brother of glaucon, and with playful violence compels them to remain, promising them not only the torch-race, but the pleasure of conversation with the young, which to socrates is a far greater attraction. EOS socrates remarks that cephalus appears not to care about riches, a quality which he ascribes to his having inherited, not acquired them, and would like to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them. EOS the portrait of the just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse which follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about the nature of justice, there is no difficulty in discerning 'who is a just man.' EOS and are our friends to be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? EOS but suppose, says socrates, that the ruler or stronger makes a mistake--then the interest of the stronger is not his interest. EOS of course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new interpretation accepted by thrasymachus himself. EOS why do you ask? EOS and experience proves that in every relation of life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer, especially where injustice is on the grand scale, which is quite another thing from the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of temples. EOS the language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the like--all which tends to show (1) that justice is the interest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice.' EOS replies socrates; but we want you to be consistent in the use of terms, and not to employ 'physician' in an exact sense, and then again 'shepherd' or 'ruler' in an inexact,--if the words are strictly taken, the ruler and the shepherd look only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own: whereas you insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office. EOS then why are they paid? EOS thrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than perfect justice, and after a little hesitation he is induced by socrates to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue and justice vice. EOS socrates praises his frankness, and assumes the attitude of one whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his opponents. EOS at the same time he is weaving a net in which thrasymachus is finally enclosed. EOS the musician, doctor, skilled artist of any sort, does not seek to gain more than the skilled, but only more than the unskilled (that is to say, he works up to a rule, standard, law, and does not exceed it), whereas the unskilled makes random efforts at excess. EOS is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice? EOS another question has not been answered: is the just or the unjust the happier? EOS and is not the end of the soul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained? EOS justice and happiness being thus shown to be inseparable, the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier has disappeared. EOS yes; and a very good entertainment with which your kindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. EOS and yet not a good entertainment--but that was my own fault, for i tasted of too many things. EOS first of all the nature of justice was the subject of our enquiry, and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and folly; and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust: and the sum of all is that i know not what justice is; how then shall i know whether the just is happy or not?... EOS this is implied in the reductio ad absurdum that 'justice is a thief,' and in the dissatisfaction which socrates expresses at the final result. EOS the expression 'an art of pay' which is described as 'common to all the arts' is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language. EOS in the last argument we trace the germ of the aristotelian doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end, which again is suggested by the arts. EOS socrates reassumes the character of a 'know-nothing;' at the same time he appears to be not wholly satisfied with the manner in which the argument has been conducted. EOS no one would observe such a compact if he were not obliged. EOS gorgias.) EOS 'and now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust. EOS imagine the unjust man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily correcting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength--the greatest villain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us place the just in his nobleness and simplicity--being, not seeming--without name or reward--clothed in his justice only--the best of men who is thought to be the worst, and let him die as he has lived. EOS i might add (but i would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injustice--they will tell you) that the just man will be scourged, racked, bound, will have his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified (literally impaled)--and all this because he ought to have preferred seeming to being. EOS you may often see the wicked in great prosperity and the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. EOS and mendicant prophets knock at rich men's doors, promising to atone for the sins of themselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and festive games, or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy good or bad by divine help and at a small charge;--they appeal to books professing to be written by musaeus and orpheus, and carry away the minds of whole cities, and promise to "get souls out of purgatory;" and if we refuse to listen to them, no one knows what will happen to us. EOS appearance is master of truth and lord of happiness. EOS i hear some one saying that "wickedness is not easily concealed," to which i reply that "nothing great is easy." EOS the obligation of maintaining authority under all circumstances and sometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and has become a sort of instinct among civilized men. EOS the divine right of kings, or more generally of governments, is one of the forms under which this natural feeling is expressed. EOS nor do they represent the average character of individuals, which cannot be explained simply on a theory of evil, but has always a counteracting element of good. EOS nor again, (2) must we forget that plato, though he agrees generally with the view implied in the argument of the two brothers, is not expressing his own final conclusion, but rather seeking to dramatize one of the aspects of ethical truth. EOS lastly, (3) the word 'happiness' involves some degree of confusion because associated in the language of modern philosophy with conscious pleasure or satisfaction, which was not equally present to his mind. EOS both the brothers touch upon the question, whether the morality of actions is determined by their consequences; and both of them go beyond the position of socrates, that justice belongs to the class of goods not desirable for themselves only, but desirable for themselves and for their results, to which he recalls them. EOS it has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of glaucon and adeimantus, but is taken by socrates to mean all virtue. EOS there is no more inconsistency in this than was inevitable in his age and country; there is no use in turning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy, which, from some other point of view, would appear equally inconsistent. EOS three points are deserving of remark in what immediately follows:--first, that the answer of socrates is altogether indirect. EOS still he maintains the true attitude of moral action. EOS only after many struggles of thought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. EOS in early ages he is not one, but one of many, the citizen of a state which is prior to him; and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law of his country or the creed of his church. EOS the subtle difference between the collective and individual action of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are sometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human action, whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower ethics to the standard of politics. EOS here follows a rustic picture of their way of life. EOS the image of the dog suggests an answer. EOS and how are they to be learned without education? EOS 'what do you mean?' EOS this is our first and great principle--god is the author of good only. EOS reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change in god, he must be changed either by another or by himself. EOS he remains for ever fairest and best in his own image. EOS for they are not ignorant of antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their enemies, nor is any madman a friend of theirs. EOS several interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in a treatise on political economy are scattered up and down the writings of plato: especially laws, population; free trade; adulteration; wills and bequests; begging; eryxias, (though not plato's), value and demand; republic, division of labour. EOS he would make retail traders only of the inferior sort of citizens (rep., laws), though he remarks, quaintly enough (laws), that 'if only the best men and the best women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to carry on retail trade, etc., then we should knew how pleasant and agreeable all these things are.' EOS to us, economies or accommodations would not be allowable unless they were required by the human faculties or necessary for the communication of knowledge to the simple and ignorant. EOS speak or act falsely in support of what was right or true. EOS whether their narratives were true or false did not seriously affect the political or social life of hellas. EOS men only began to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them to be immoral. EOS these reflections tend to show that the difference between plato and ourselves, though not unimportant, is not so great as might at first sight appear. EOS and so without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two forms of religion, the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and the customary worship of the temple; on the other hand, there was the religion of the philosopher, who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas, but did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to aesculapius, or to be seen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun. EOS the greek and roman religions were gradually permeated by the spirit of philosophy; having lost their ancient meaning, they were resolved into poetry and morality; and probably were never purer than at the time of their decay, when their influence over the world was waning. EOS the lie in the soul may be further compared with the sin against the holy ghost (luke), allowing for the difference between greek and christian modes of speaking. EOS socrates is here answering the question which he had himself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman; and he is also contrasting the nature of god and man. EOS reserving for another place the greater questions of religion or education, we may note further, (1) the approval of the old traditional education of greece; (2) the preparation which plato is making for the attack on homer and the poets; (3) the preparation which he is also making for the use of economies in the state; (4) the contemptuous and at the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes to the 'chronique scandaleuse' of the gods. EOS there is another motive in purifying religion, which is to banish fear; for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death, or who believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below. EOS as little can we admit the sorrows and sympathies of the homeric heroes:--achilles, the son of thetis, in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and down the sea-shore in distraction; or priam, the cousin of the gods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. EOS a good man is not prostrated at the loss of children or fortune. EOS truth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as we were saying, is useless to the gods, and only useful to men as a medicine. EOS in the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists in self-control and obedience to authority. EOS there is a nobler strain heard in the words:--'endure, my soul, thou hast endured worse.' EOS the youth who believes that such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing in their veins will be too ready to imitate their example. EOS now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to come; and narrative is of three kinds, the simple, the imitative, and a composition of the two. EOS these are the three styles--which of them is to be admitted into our state? EOS if they imitate they should imitate, not any meanness or baseness, but the good only; for the mask which the actor wears is apt to become his face. EOS the man who has no self-respect, on the contrary, will imitate anybody and anything; sounds of nature and cries of animals alike; his whole performance will be imitation of gesture and voice. EOS now in the descriptive style there are few changes, but in the dramatic there are a great many. EOS poets and musicians use either, or a compound of both, and this compound is very attractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar. EOS next we pass on to gymnastics; about which i would remark, that the soul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if we educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge, and need only give a general outline of the course to be pursued. EOS but our warrior athletes must be wide-awake dogs, and must also be inured to all changes of food and climate. EOS where gluttony and intemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders; and law and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a state take an interest in them. EOS but what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home? EOS whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill. do you know a maxim of phocylides--that 'when a man begins to be rich' (or, perhaps, a little sooner) 'he should practise virtue'? EOS this was the reason why asclepius and his sons practised no such art. EOS how is he to be wise and also innocent? EOS when young a good man is apt to be deceived by evil-doers, because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and therefore the judge should be of a certain age; his youth should have been innocent, and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the practice of it, but by the observation of it in others. EOS vice may be known of virtue, but cannot know virtue. EOS not that this division of music and gymnastic really corresponds to soul and body; for they are both equally concerned with the soul, which is tamed by the one and aroused and sustained by the other. EOS the passionate disposition when it has too much gymnastic is hardened and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper which has too much music becomes enervated. EOS the next question is, who are to be our rulers? EOS and therefore our guardians must be men who have been tried by many tests, like gold in the refiner's fire, and have been passed first through danger, then through pleasure, and at every age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain, in full command of themselves and their principles; having all their faculties in harmonious exercise for their country's good. EOS the tale must be imparted, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, lastly to the people. EOS they may be compared with modern citations from scripture, which have often a great rhetorical power even when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of. EOS notwithstanding the fascination which the word 'classical' exercises over us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the greek poetry which has come down to us. EOS they are not examples to be followed by us; for the use of language ought in every generation to become clearer and clearer. EOS like shakespere, they were great in spite, not in consequence, of their imperfections of expression. EOS we are living upon the fragments of them, and find in a few broken stones the standard of truth and beauty. EOS he also indicates that the system of caste, which existed in a great part of the ancient, and is by no means extinct in the modern european world, should be set aside from time to time in favour of merit. EOS we do not know whether they are to carry arms, and whether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the communistic regulations respecting property and marriage. EOS aristotle, in his criticism on the position of the lower classes, does not perceive that the poetical creation is 'like the air, invulnerable,' and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic (pol.). EOS the second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting questions--how far can the mind control the body? EOS is the relation between them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? EOS reason and the desires, the intellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as to form a single human being. EOS there is a tendency in us which says 'drink.' EOS we are disappointed to find that plato, in the general condemnation which he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day, depreciates the effects of diet. EOS he would like to have diseases of a definite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. EOS neither does he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely influence the body than by the control of eating and drinking; or any other action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of the will can be more simple or truly asserted. EOS (3) the description of the state sometimes as a reality, and then again as a work of imagination only; these are the arts by which he sustains the reader's interest. EOS (4) connecting links, or the preparation for the entire expulsion of the poets in book x. EOS adeimantus said: 'suppose a person to argue, socrates, that you make your citizens miserable, and this by their own free-will; they are the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men, lands and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and are always mounting guard.' EOS 'now i can well imagine a fool's paradise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple and fine linen, and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand, that they may work a little when they please; and cobblers and all the other classes of a state lose their distinctive character. EOS 'but if many states join their resources, shall we not be in danger?' EOS but our state, while she remains true to her principles, will be in very deed the mightiest of hellenic states. EOS the care of the governors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation; alter the songs of a country, damon says, and you will soon end by altering its laws. EOS like invites like for good or for evil. EOS education will correct deficiencies and supply the power of self-government. EOS but don't get into a passion: to see our statesmen trying their nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the hydra-like rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. EOS they were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. EOS it is associated too much with the comforts and conveniences of life; too little with 'the goods of the soul which we desire for their own sake.' EOS for these reasons 'the greatest happiness' principle is not the true foundation of ethics. EOS to gorgias and philebus). EOS in the most commercial and utilitarian states of society the power of ideas remains. EOS well, i said, i will lead the way, but do you follow. EOS first then, of wisdom: the state which we have called into being will be wise because politic. EOS now the ground is education, and the laws are the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither the soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them out. EOS the expression really means that the better principle in a man masters the worse. EOS there are in cities whole classes--women, slaves and the like--who correspond to the worse, and a few only to the better; and in our state the former class are held under control by the latter. EOS 'to both of them.' EOS and this evil is injustice, or every man doing another's business. EOS each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the three parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the state, although the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony than the first two. EOS justice, again, is a more abstract notion than the other virtues, and therefore, from plato's point of view, the foundation of them, to which they are referred and which in idea precedes them. EOS there is no necessity to mention all the possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume that opposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation. EOS and to the class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and avoidance. EOS for example, the term 'greater' is simply relative to 'less,' and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. EOS now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'drink;' the rational one, which says 'do not drink.' EOS the wisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which has authority and reason. EOS moreover, our old division of labour, which required that there should be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what was to follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which begins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts harmoniously in every relation of life. EOS thus there are five forms in all, both of states and of souls...  in attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties, plato takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. EOS this case therefore has to be excluded. EOS there is a difficulty in understanding what plato meant by 'the longer way': he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not be satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction. EOS 'certainly not,' said adeimantus, raising his voice. EOS 'because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting women and children, of whom you have slily disposed under the general formula that friends have all things in common.' EOS glaucon added, 'yes, socrates, and there is reason in spending the whole of life in such discussions; but pray, without more ado, tell us how this community is to be carried out, and how the interval between birth and education is to be filled up.' EOS what is desirable? EOS they have the same employments--the only difference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other weaker. EOS we do not consider that the difference may be purely nominal and accidental; for example, a bald man and a hairy man are opposed in a single point of view, but you cannot infer that because a bald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. EOS simply because the opposition between them is partial only, like the difference between a male physician and a female physician, not running through the whole nature, like the difference between a physician and a carpenter. EOS the first wave is past, and the argument is compelled to admit that men and women have common duties and pursuits. EOS the expediency i do not doubt; i am not so sure of the possibility. EOS 'certainly.' EOS the good must be paired with the good, and the bad with the bad, and the offspring of the one must be reared, and of the other destroyed; in this way the flock will be preserved in prime condition. EOS hymeneal festivals will be celebrated at times fixed with an eye to population, and the brides and bridegrooms will meet at them; and by an ingenious system of lots the rulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come together, and that those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors--the latter will ascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers. EOS the greatest good of a state is unity; the greatest evil, discord and distraction. EOS but is such a community possible?--as among the animals, so also among men; and if possible, in what way possible? EOS first of all he shall be crowned by all the youths in the army; secondly, he shall receive the right hand of fellowship; and thirdly, do you think that there is any harm in his being kissed? EOS he shall be worshipped after death in the manner prescribed by the oracle; and not only he, but all other benefactors of the state who die in any other way, shall be admitted to the same honours. EOS there is meanness and feminine malice in making an enemy of the dead body, when the soul which was the owner has fled--like a dog who cannot reach his assailants, and quarrels with the stones which are thrown at him instead. EOS and on similar grounds there should be a limit to the devastation of hellenic territory--the houses should not be burnt, nor more than the annual produce carried off. EOS the war is not against a whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men, women, and children, but only against a few guilty persons; when they are punished peace will be restored. EOS well, then, we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after justice, and the just man answered to the just state. EOS nature will not allow words to be fully realized; but if i am to try and realize the ideal of the state in a measure, i think that an approach may be made to the perfection of which i dream by one or two, i do not say slight, but possible changes in the present constitution of states. EOS 'and i was right,' he replied; 'however, i will stand by you as a sort of do-nothing, well-meaning ally.' EOS the snub-nosed youth is said to have a winning grace; the beak of another has a royal look; the featureless are faultless; the dark are manly, the fair angels; the sickly have a new term of endearment invented expressly for them, which is 'honey-pale.' EOS all that can be said of the extravagance of plato's proposals is anticipated by himself. EOS some defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the communistic plan. EOS nothing is told us of the application of communism to the lower classes; nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of being made out. EOS they are partly facetious, but also contain a germ of truth. EOS that science is a whole, remains a true principle of inductive as well as of metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is still the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in ancient times. EOS to the mind of early thinkers, the conception of not-being was dark and mysterious; they did not see that this terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge was only a logical determination. EOS and yet all the time he may be right. EOS i should say that he is quite right. EOS i shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a hand i am at the invention of allegories. EOS the philosopher should not beg of mankind to be put in authority over them. EOS the wise man should not seek the rich, as the proverb bids, but every man, whether rich or poor, must knock at the door of the physician when he has need of him. EOS some persons say that the sophists are the corrupters of youth; but is not public opinion the real sophist who is everywhere present--in those very persons, in the assembly, in the courts, in the camp, in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re-echoed by the surrounding hills? EOS nor is this all. EOS for if he will not yield to opinion, there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death. EOS vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts into her temple. EOS 'a great work, too, will have been accomplished by them.' EOS great, yes, but not the greatest; for man is a social being, and can only attain his highest development in the society which is best suited to him. EOS enough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name. EOS in the first place, i say boldly that nothing can be worse than the present mode of study. EOS they will soon change their opinion if they are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the philosopher. EOS consider, again, that the many hate not the true but the false philosophers--the pretenders who force their way in without invitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles, which is unlike the spirit of philosophy. EOS 'they will be less disposed to quarrel.' EOS intelligence and spirit are not often combined with steadiness; the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to intellectual toil. EOS 'and what are the highest?' EOS and will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science? EOS there is, i said; and bearing in mind our two suns or principles, imagine further their corresponding worlds--one of the visible, the other of the intelligible; you may assist your fancy by figuring the distinction under the image of a line divided into two unequal parts, and may again subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere. EOS in this division the mind works with figures and numbers, the images of which are taken not from the shadows, but from the objects, although the truth of them is seen only with the mind's eye; and they are used as hypotheses without being analysed. EOS he is aware of the importance of 'classifying according to nature,' and will try to 'separate the limbs of science without breaking them' (phaedr.). EOS he inquires into a portion of knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be embraced by a single mind or life. EOS the imperfection, or rather the higher and more elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the precision of numbers or of symbols. EOS concerning the false philosopher, socrates argues that the best is most liable to corruption; and that the finer nature is more likely to suffer from alien conditions. EOS the world, the church, their own profession, any political or party organization, are always carrying them off their legs and teaching them to apply high and holy names to their own prejudices and interests. EOS the question is asked,--why are the citizens of states so hostile to philosophy? EOS in the latter part of the sixth book, three questions have to be considered: 1st, the nature of the longer and more circuitous way, which is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of book iv; 2nd, the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation of the divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding faculties of the soul:  1. of the higher method of knowledge in plato we have only a glimpse. EOS like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times his mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to realize. EOS he is hastening on to the 'end of the intellectual world' without even making a beginning of them. EOS anticipations or divinations, or prophetic glimpses of truths whether concerning man or nature, seem to stand in the same relation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern inductive science. EOS these 'guesses at truth' were not made at random; they arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first principles in nature which the genius of the greek, contemplating the expanse of heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the distance. EOS the answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the omission of particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form which experience supplies (phaedo). EOS hence plato is led to introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme of his philosophy. EOS when divested of metaphor, a straight line or a square has no more to do with right and justice than a crooked line with vice. EOS the figurative association was mistaken for a real one; and thus the three latter divisions of the platonic proportion were constructed. EOS nor indeed does the relation of shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas. EOS he is also preparing the way, as his manner is, for the shadows of images at the beginning of the seventh book, and the imitation of an imitation in the tenth. EOS of the four faculties, faith in the lower division has an intermediate position (cp. EOS for the use of the word faith or belief, (greek), timaeus), contrasting equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows (greek) and the higher certainty of understanding (greek) and reason (greek). EOS but there is a knowledge of the understanding which is incomplete and in motion always, because unable to rest in the subordinate ideas. EOS they then cease to be hypotheses or pictures, and become essential parts of a higher truth which is at once their first principle and their final cause. EOS the imperfect intelligence of glaucon, and the reluctance of socrates to make a beginning, mark the difficulty of the subject. EOS the meagreness or negativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their power. EOS they have become the forms under which all things were comprehended. EOS the idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought, which were beginning to take the place of the old mythology. EOS to ask whether god was the maker of it, or made by it, would be like asking whether god could be conceived apart from goodness, or goodness apart from god. EOS we have perhaps arrived at the stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is aiming at, better than he did himself. EOS will not their eyes be dazzled, and will they not try to get away from the light to something which they are able to behold without blinking? EOS some time will pass before they get the habit of perceiving at all; and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the stars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is. EOS he who attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he is unwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they behold in them--he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never in their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance. EOS and this is conversion; other virtues are almost like bodily habits, and may be acquired in the same manner, but intelligence has a diviner life, and is indestructible, turning either to good or evil according to the direction given. EOS and have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world? EOS and the only life which is better than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy, which is also the best preparation for the government of a state. EOS and what training will draw the soul upwards? EOS now the stimulating class are the things which suggest contrast and relation. EOS again, the sight beholds great and small, but only in a confused chaos, and not until they are distinguished does the question arise of their respective natures; we are thus led on to the distinction between the visible and intelligible. EOS 'every man is his own best friend.' EOS still the charm of the pursuit wins upon men, and, if government would lend a little assistance, there might be great progress made. EOS the vision of knowledge of which i speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the mind. EOS 'yes,' replied glaucon, 'i like to see them laying their ears alongside of their neighbours' faces--some saying, "that's a new note," others declaring that the two notes are the same.' EOS all these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable if they are regarded in their natural relations to one another. EOS 'certainly not. EOS and yet, glaucon, is not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the intellectual world, and which was by us compared to the effort of sight, when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at the images which gave the shadows? EOS there can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been disciplined in the previous sciences. EOS dialectic may be further described as that science which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature, which distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle against all opponents in the cause of good. EOS justice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they will be the saviours of our state; disciples of another sort would only make philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present. EOS the danger may be illustrated by a parallel case:--imagine a person who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers, and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious son. EOS he is seduced into the life of pleasure, and becomes a lawless person and a rogue. EOS the case of such speculators is very pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years' old pupils may not require this pity, let us take every possible care that young persons do not study philosophy too early. EOS a man of thirty does not run on in this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct. EOS yes, and of our governesses, for the women will share in all things with the men. EOS at the commencement of book vii, under the figure of a cave having an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light, he returns to view the divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly, as in a picture, the result which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought in the previous discussion; at the same time casting a glance onward at the dialectical process, which is represented by the way leading from darkness to light. EOS the mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind, but when sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished, then philosophy begins. EOS the science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions. EOS the modern mathematician will readily sympathise with plato's delight in the properties of pure mathematics. EOS but while acknowledging their value in education, he sees also that they have no connexion with our higher moral and intellectual ideas. EOS there is no reason to suppose that he is speaking of the ideal numbers; but he is describing numbers which are pure abstractions, to which he assigns a real and separate existence, which, as 'the teachers of the art' (meaning probably the pythagoreans) would have affirmed, repel all attempts at subdivision, and in which unity and every other number are conceived of as absolute. EOS two passages seem to require more particular explanations. EOS to us, the perceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which accompanies them. EOS the first action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this chaos, and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under which the confused impressions of sense may be arranged. EOS first, there have been great men who, in the language of burke, 'have been too much given to general maxims,' who, like j.s. EOS they are full of light, but the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or blindness. EOS with this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another--of those who see not far into the distance, but what is near only; who have been engaged all their lives in a trade or a profession; who are limited to a set or sect of their own. EOS men of this kind have no universal except their own interests or the interests of their class, no principle but the opinion of persons like themselves, no knowledge of affairs beyond what they pick up in the streets or at their club. EOS they 'light upon every flower,' following their own wayward wills, or because the wind blows them. EOS they suppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are playing the game of 'follow my leader.' EOS plato is very well aware that the faculty of the mathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense which recognizes and combines first principles. EOS besides the perfect state there are only four of any note in hellas:--first, the famous lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth; secondly, oligarchy, a state full of evils; thirdly, democracy, which follows next in order; fourthly, tyranny, which is the disease or death of all government. EOS but how did timocracy arise out of the perfect state? EOS for whereas divine creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation is in a number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and three intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating, dissimilating, and yet perfectly commensurate with each other. EOS they say that the two races, the iron and brass, and the silver and gold, will draw the state different ways;--the one will take to trade and moneymaking, and the others, having the true riches and not caring for money, will resist them: the contest will end in a compromise; they will agree to have private property, and will enslave their fellow-citizens who were once their friends and nurturers. EOS but they will retain their warlike character, and will be chiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule. EOS and what manner of man answers to such a state? EOS 'in love of contention,' replied adeimantus, 'he will be like our friend glaucon.' EOS he is self-asserting and ill-educated, yet fond of literature, although not himself a speaker,--fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power and honour, which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms,--fond, too, of gymnastics and of hunting. EOS the next form of government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor is it difficult to see how such a state arises. EOS thus much of the origin,--let us next consider the evils of oligarchy. EOS the greatest evil of all is that a man may sell his property and have no place in the state; while there is one class which has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. EOS the lesson which he thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves politics, represses his pride, and saves pence. EOS the love of honour turns to love of money; the conversion is instantaneous. EOS he is the son of a miserly oligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary pleasures. EOS for example, the pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a certain point; beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind, and the excess may be avoided. EOS falsehoods and illusions ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into the country of the lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. EOS such is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to the unnecessary. EOS there remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all states--tyranny and the tyrant. EOS the state demands the strong wine of freedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes and insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved principle. EOS at last the citizens become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written or unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master. EOS these two classes are to the state what phlegm and bile are to the human body; and the state-physician, or legislator, must get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of the hive. EOS and there is another class in democratic states, of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is moreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and they make up the mass of the people. EOS when the people meet, they are omnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey, of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a taste only to the mob. EOS the people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from this root the tree of tyranny springs. EOS yes, he will, after having taken away his arms. EOS and the people have jumped from the fear of slavery into slavery, out of the smoke into the fire. EOS of this law the famous geometrical figure or number is the expression. EOS his ideal was not to be attained in the course of ages, but was to spring in full armour from the head of the legislator. EOS to him democracy is a state of individualism or dissolution; in which every one is doing what is right in his own eyes. EOS his deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved for the tyrant, who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness, and who in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an almost impossible existence, without that remnant of good which, in plato's opinion, was required to give power to evil (book i). EOS still more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals: there is the family picture of the father and mother and the old servant of the timocratical man, and the outward respectability and inherent meanness of the oligarchical; the uncontrolled licence and freedom of the democrat, in which the young alcibiades seems to be depicted, doing right or wrong as he pleases, and who at last, like the prodigal, goes into a far country (note here the play of language by which the democratic man is himself represented under the image of a state having a citadel and receiving embassies); and there is the wild-beast nature, which breaks loose in his successor. EOS this is a puzzle almost as great as the number of the beast in the book of revelation, and though apparently known to aristotle, is referred to by cicero as a proverb of obscurity (ep. EOS but such a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which aristotle speaks of the number (pol. EOS our hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an accurate study of the words themselves; on which a faint light is thrown by the parallel passage in the ninth book. EOS he also speaks of a human or imperfect number, having four terms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another in certain proportions; these he converts into figures, and finds in them when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of number, which give two 'harmonies,' the one square, the other oblong; but he does not say that the square number answers to the divine, or the oblong number to the human cycle; nor is any intimation given that the first or divine number represents the period of the world, the second the period of the state, or of the human race as zeller supposes; nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned (arist.). EOS the conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as follows. EOS each term is to the preceding as 3/2. EOS but the coincidences in the numbers which follow are in favour of the explanation. EOS the point of interest is that plato should have used such a symbol, and that so much of the pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him. EOS book ix. EOS last of all comes the tyrannical man, about whom we have to enquire, whence is he, and how does he live--in happiness or in misery? EOS now imagine that the youth has become a father, and has a son who is exposed to the same temptations, and has companions who lead him into every sort of iniquity, and parents and friends who try to keep him right. EOS well then, i fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries, and love will be the lord and master of the house. EOS love urges them on; and they must be gratified by force or fraud, or if not, they become painful and troublesome; and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones, so will the son take possession of the goods of his parents; if they show signs of refusing, he will defraud and deceive them; and if they openly resist, what then? EOS but in time of peace they stay at home and do mischief; they are the thieves, footpads, cut-purses, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak, they turn false-witnesses and informers. EOS yes, i said; but small and great are relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them approach those of the tyrant, whom this class, growing strong and numerous, create out of themselves. EOS such men in their early days live with flatterers, and they themselves flatter others, in order to gain their ends; but they soon discard their followers when they have no longer any need of them; they are always either masters or servants,--the joys of friendship are unknown to them. EOS and they are utterly treacherous and unjust, if the nature of justice be at all understood by us. EOS like man, like state,--the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny, which is the extreme opposite of the royal state; for one is the best and the other the worst. EOS and the freedom is of the bad, and the slavery of the good; and this applies to the man as well as to the state; for his soul is full of meanness and slavery, and the better part is enslaved to the worse. EOS no, not the most miserable, for there is yet a more miserable. EOS he is like a wealthy owner of slaves, only he has more of them than any private individual. EOS having so many evils, will not the most miserable of men be still more miserable in a public station? EOS master of others when he is not master of himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete; the meanest of slaves and the most abject of flatterers; wanting all things, and never able to satisfy his desires; always in fear and distraction, like the state of which he is the representative. EOS his jealous, hateful, faithless temper grows worse with command; he is more and more faithless, envious, unrighteous,--the most wretched of men, a misery to himself and to others. EOS the son of ariston (the best) is of opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest, and that this is he who is the most royal master of himself; and that the unjust man is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his state. EOS and i add further--'seen or unseen by gods or men.' EOS honour he has equally with them; they are 'judged of him,' but he is 'not judged of them,' for they never attain to the knowledge of true being. EOS and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the rational part of the soul, and a life passed in such pleasure is the pleasantest. EOS but can that which is neither become both? EOS and these are not the only pleasures, for there are others which have no preceding pains. EOS pure pleasure then is not the absence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most of the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of pain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their anticipations before they come. EOS all this arises out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. EOS the man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure. EOS but now, let us reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally in error. EOS 'what, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world' and become more and more wicked? EOS but in heaven, i replied, there is a pattern of such a city, and he who wishes may order his life after that image. EOS he is not, like the cynics, opposed to all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of the soul shall have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the epicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of pain. EOS neither do we like to admit that the pleasures of knowledge, though more elevating, are not more lasting than other pleasures, and are almost equally dependent on the accidents of our bodily state (introduction to philebus). EOS at the end of the 9th book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city of philosophers on earth. EOS there, for the kingdom of god is within you.') EOS book x. many things pleased me in the order of our state, but there was nothing which i liked better than the regulation about poetry. EOS i do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage on the understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge which heals error. EOS there is one idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker of each had in his mind when making them; he did not make the ideas of beds and tables, but he made beds and tables according to the ideas. EOS exactly so; and the painter is such a creator as you are with the mirror, and he is even more unreal than the carpenter; although neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be supposed to make the absolute bed. EOS god only made one, nor could he have made more than one; for if there had been two, there would always have been a third--more absolute and abstract than either, under which they would have been included. EOS and the tragic poet is an imitator, and, like every other imitator, is thrice removed from the king and from the truth. EOS the painter imitates not the original bed, but the bed made by the carpenter. EOS 'no, indeed; and creophylus (flesh-child) was even more unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as tradition says, homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve.' EOS if protagoras and prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can manage house or state without them, is it likely that homer and hesiod would have been allowed to go about as beggars--i mean if they had really been able to do the world any good?--would not men have compelled them to stay where they were, or have followed them about in order to get education? EOS the painter paints, and the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but neither understands the use of them--the knowledge of this is confined to the horseman; and so of other things. EOS imitation, then, is devoid of knowledge, being only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic and epic poets are imitators in the highest degree. EOS allow me to explain my meaning: objects are differently seen when in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a distance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to impose upon us. EOS and the art of measuring and weighing and calculating comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for, as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the same and at the same time, cannot both of them be true. EOS and the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of poetry as well as painting. EOS but is a man in harmony with himself when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? EOS 'in the latter case.' EOS and the better part of us is ready to follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and distraction at the recollection of our troubles. EOS whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed, especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of her. EOS he indulges the feelings, while he enfeebles the reason; and we refuse to allow him to have authority over the mind of man; for he has no measure of greater and less, and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth. EOS but we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment--the power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. EOS when we hear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious length, you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and yet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as effeminate and unmanly (ion). EOS we confess her charms; but if she cannot show that she is useful as well as delightful, like rational lovers, we must renounce our love, though endeared to us by early associations. EOS and it is not worth while to forsake justice and virtue for the attractions of poetry, any more than for the sake of honour or wealth. EOS 'then let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.' EOS in all things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy them, nothing else will. EOS the soul too has her own corrupting principles, which are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like. EOS nothing which was not destroyed from within ever perished by external affection of evil. EOS neither can the soul, which is one thing, be corrupted by the body, which is another, unless she herself is infected. EOS if a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer is--then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and not die of themselves? EOS 'truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but i rather believe that the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.' EOS if sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot destroy the soul, hardly will anything else destroy her. EOS neither is the soul variable and diverse; for that which is immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition. EOS and you must allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the fortunate unjust--they bear rule in the city, they marry and give in marriage to whom they will; and the evils which you attributed to the unfortunate just, do really fall in the end on the unjust, although, as you implied, their sufferings are better veiled in silence. EOS 'i should like to hear about them.' EOS him they told to look and listen, as he was to be their messenger to men from the world below. EOS one day more brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column of light which binds together the whole universe. EOS the largest (the fixed stars) was spangled--the seventh (the sun) was brightest--the eighth (the moon) shone by the light of the seventh--the second and fifth (saturn and mercury) were most like one another and yellower than the eighth--the third (jupiter) had the whitest light--the fourth (mars) was red--the sixth (venus) was in whiteness second. EOS on their arrival the pilgrims went to lachesis, and there was an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees lots, and samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: 'mortal souls, hear the words of lachesis, the daughter of necessity. EOS a new period of mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you please; the responsibility of choosing is with you--god is blameless.' EOS he then placed on the ground before them the samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were all sorts of lives, of men and of animals. EOS er himself was prevented from drinking. EOS thus, glaucon, the tale has been saved, and will be our salvation, if we believe that the soul is immortal, and hold fast to the heavenly way of justice and knowledge. EOS so shall we pass undefiled over the river of forgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the gods, and have a crown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the millennial pilgrimage of the other. EOS why plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and dramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and especially to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that truth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are some indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed in poetry--some elements of imagination which always entwine with reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably associated with the impurities of the old hellenic mythology; why he should try homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of utility,--are questions which have always been debated amongst students of plato. EOS though unable to give a complete answer to them, we may show--first, that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of his age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth as well as the error which is contained in them. EOS there is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of plato than a sense of the decline and decay both in literature and in politics which marked his own age. EOS nor can he have been expected to look with favour on the licence of aristophanes, now at the end of his career, who had begun by satirizing socrates in the clouds, and in a similar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of ideal commonwealths in his eccleziazusae, or female parliament (laws). EOS but great dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with firmness or strength of mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally associated with a weak or dissolute character. EOS still more would this apply to the greatest works of art, which seem to be the visible embodiment of the divine. EOS he does not admit aristotle's theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are a purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only to afford the opportunity of indulging them. EOS for there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of the lower--thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by ourselves, may find an utterance in the words of poets. EOS
