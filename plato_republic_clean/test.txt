plato among the greeks, like bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. EOS rep.; polit. EOS it would have told of a struggle for liberty (cp. EOS tim. EOS ), singing a hymn of triumph over marathon and salamis, perhaps making the reflection of herodotus (v. 78) where he contemplates the growth of the athenian empire--'how brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the athenians so far exceed every other state of hellas in greatness!' EOS in english philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works of the cambridge platonists, but in great original writers like berkeley or coleridge, to plato and his ideas. EOS that there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. EOS the subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. EOS to this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded to the question--what is justice, stripped of appearances? EOS in the age of plato there was no regular mode of publication, and an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his friends. EOS there may be some use in such general descriptions, but they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer. EOS the truth is, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; nor need anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the association of ideas, and which does not interfere with the general purpose. EOS every shade of light and dark, of truth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination. EOS we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has conceived is practicable or not, or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer. EOS which is proposed by him will do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a writer who, like plato, is notoriously careless of chronology (cp. EOS rep., symp., 193 a, etc. EOS the principal characters in the republic are cephalus, polemarchus, thrasymachus, socrates, glaucon, and adeimantus. EOS cephalus, the patriarch of the house, has been appropriately engaged in offering a sacrifice. EOS 16), the aged cephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which follows, and which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety (cp. EOS the 'chalcedonian giant,' thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard in the phaedrus, is the personification of the sophists, according to plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. EOS whether such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were really held either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easily grow up--they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers in thucydides; but we are concerned at present with plato's description of him, and not with the historical reality. EOS the inequality of the contest adds greatly to the humour of the scene. EOS he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates, but his noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his assailant. EOS to phaedo), three actors are introduced. EOS in the second book, when glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered without regard to their consequences, adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences; and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book that socrates fails in making his citizens happy, and is answered that happiness is not the first but the second thing, not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good government of a state. EOS it is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative, as glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the dialogue. EOS for example, throughout the greater part of the sixth book, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of good are discussed with adeimantus. EOS glaucon resumes his place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending the higher education of socrates, and makes some false hits in the course of the discussion. EOS once more adeimantus returns with the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to the contentious state; in the next book he is again superseded, and glaucon continues to the end. EOS in the first book we have more of the real socrates, such as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon, in the earliest dialogues of plato, and in the apology. EOS he also becomes more dogmatic and constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political or the speculative ideas of the real socrates. EOS there is no evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socratic teaching, though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. EOS neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taught the immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple glaucon in the republic (cp. EOS ); nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the greek mythology. EOS and this use of examples or images, though truly socratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what has been already described, or is about to be described, in the abstract. EOS thus the figure of the cave in book vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book vi. EOS the common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or has only partially admitted it. EOS but they are to be pitied or laughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their nostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a hydra's head. EOS the whole work is supposed to be recited by socrates on the day after the festival to a small party, consisting of critias, timaeus, hermocrates, and another; this we learn from the first words of the timaeus. EOS when the rhetorical advantage of reciting the dialogue has been gained, the attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor is the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the narrative. EOS of the numerous company, three only take any serious part in the discussion; nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to the torch-race, or talked, as in the symposium, through the night. EOS they return to the house of cephalus, polemarchus' father, now in extreme old age, who is found sitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice. EOS 'and there is something in what they say, socrates, but not so much as they imagine--as themistocles replied to the seriphian, "neither you, if you had been an athenian, nor i, if i had been a seriphian, would ever have been famous," i might in like manner reply to you, neither a good poor man can be happy in age, nor yet a bad rich man.' EOS cephalus answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon you, and then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to do injustice through poverty, and never to have deceived anyone, are felt to be unspeakable blessings. EOS he meant that you were to do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.' EOS but then justice is a thief, though a hero notwithstanding, like autolycus, the homeric hero, who was 'excellent above all men in theft and perjury'--to such a pass have you and homer and simonides brought us; though i do not forget that the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of enemies. EOS and still there arises another question: are friends to be interpreted as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? EOS the final conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just return evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man, periander, perdiccas, or ismenias the theban (about b.c. EOS similar words are applied by the persian mystic poet to the divine being when the questioning spirit is stirred within him:--'if because i do evil, thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between thee and me?' EOS we may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which not only arises out of the conflict of established principles in particular cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is prior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. EOS the 'interrogation' of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of homer; the conclusion that the maxim, 'do good to your friends and harm to your enemies,' being erroneous, could not have been the word of any great man, are all of them very characteristic of the platonic socrates. EOS 'socrates,' he says, 'what folly is this?--why do you agree to be vanquished by one another in a pretended argument?' EOS 'listen,' he says, 'my answer is that might is right, justice the interest of the stronger: now praise me.' EOS in what follows thrasymachus does in fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for he affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. EOS thrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion, when he makes a bold diversion. EOS what a question! EOS for you fancy that shepherds and rulers never think of their own interest, but only of their sheep or subjects, whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use, sheep and subjects alike. EOS not wickedness therefore, but semi-wickedness flourishes in states,--a remnant of good is needed in order to make union in action possible,--there is no kingdom of evil in this world. EOS to this we reply, that every art has an end and an excellence or virtue by which the end is accomplished. EOS among early enquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up the void of speculation; and at first the comparison of the arts and the virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious. EOS the next generation cleared up these perplexities; or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis of them. EOS the contemporaries of plato were in a state of transition, and had not yet fully realized the common-sense distinction of aristotle, that 'virtue is concerned with action, art with production' (nic. EOS eth. EOS it is suggested by the argument, and seems to extend the conception of art to doing as well as making. EOS for those who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed or ill-treated. EOS the second of the three arguments, 'that the just does not aim at excess,' has a real meaning, though wrapped up in an enigmatical form. EOS 'when workmen strive to do better than well,    they do confound their skill in covetousness.' EOS the final reconcilement of justice and happiness and the identity of the individual and the state are also intimated. EOS thrasymachus is pacified, but the intrepid glaucon insists on continuing the argument. EOS socrates answers that this is the doctrine of thrasymachus which he rejects. EOS he considered that the most important point of all had been omitted:--'men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards; parents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue. EOS and other advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind, such as wealthy marriages and high offices. EOS some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth generation. EOS to appearance then i will turn,--i will put on the show of virtue and trail behind me the fox of archilochus. EOS union and force and rhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know that there are gods? EOS only from the poets, who acknowledge that they may be appeased by sacrifices. EOS even if a man knows the better part he will not be angry with others; for he knows also that more than human virtue is needed to save a man, and that he only praises justice who is incapable of injustice. EOS and theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of the state, which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected and enlarged by custom and law (although capable also of perversion), any more than they describe the origin of society, which is to be sought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man. EOS neither the stoical ideal nor the christian ideal is true as a fact, but they may serve as a basis of education, and may exercise an ennobling influence. EOS he is exhibiting socrates for the first time undergoing the socratic interrogation. EOS in their attempt to view justice as an internal principle, and in their condemnation of the poets, they anticipate him. EOS under the fanciful illustration of the large letters he implies that he will only look for justice in society, and that from the state he will proceed to the individual. EOS his answer in substance amounts to this,--that under favourable conditions, i.e. EOS he knows not how to answer them, although he is afraid of deserting justice in the hour of need. EOS society arises out of the wants of man. EOS his first want is food; his second a house; his third a coat. EOS a city which includes all this will have far exceeded the limit of four or five, and yet not be very large. EOS i see; you want not only a state, but a luxurious state; and possibly in the more complex frame we may sooner find justice and injustice. EOS there will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks, barbers, tire-women, nurses, artists; swineherds and neatherds too for the animals, and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is the source. EOS to feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part of our neighbour's land, and they will want a part of ours. EOS the art of war cannot be learned in a day, and there must be a natural aptitude for military duties. EOS but these spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one another; the union of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears to be an impossibility, and the guardian of a state requires both qualities. EOS but what shall their education be? EOS some of them are very improper, as we may see in the great instances of homer and hesiod, who not only tell lies but bad lies; stories about uranus and saturn, which are immoral as well as false, and which should never be spoken of to young persons, or indeed at all; or, if at all, then in a mystery, after the sacrifice, not of an eleusinian pig, but of some unprocurable animal. EOS shall our youth be encouraged to beat their fathers by the example of zeus, or our citizens be incited to quarrel by hearing or seeing representations of strife among the gods? EOS but that the deed was evil, and god the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will allow no one, old or young, to utter. EOS but some one will say that god, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form in relation to us. EOS god then is true, he is absolutely true; he changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by word or sign. EOS he indulges, like rousseau, in a picture of primitive life--an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence on the imagination of mankind, but he does not seriously mean to say that one is better than the other (politicus); nor can any inference be drawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the second, such as aristotle appears to draw in the politics. EOS yet this is not very different from saying that children must be taught through the medium of imagination as well as reason; that their minds can only develope gradually, and that there is much which they must learn without understanding. EOS this is also the substance of plato's view, though he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat differently from modern ethical writers, respecting truth and falsehood. EOS a greek in the age of plato attached no importance to the question whether his religion was an historical fact. EOS and so in all religions: the consideration of their morality comes first, afterwards the truth of the documents in which they are recorded, or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of them. EOS but in modern times, and in protestant countries perhaps more than in catholic, we have been too much inclined to identify the historical with the moral; and some have refused to believe in religion at all, unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of the record. EOS the zeus of homer and hesiod easily passed into the 'royal mind' of plato (philebus); the giant heracles became the knight-errant and benefactor of mankind. EOS the greatest unconsciousness of the greatest untruth, e.g. EOS for god is truth, but mankind can only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial, or false. EOS they must be gently requested not to abuse hell; they may be reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging. EOS the amatory exploits of peirithous and theseus are equally unworthy. EOS either these so-called sons of gods were not the sons of gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them, any more than the gods themselves are the authors of evil. EOS but if you throw the dialogue into the 'oratio obliqua,' the passage will run thus: the priest came and prayed apollo that the achaeans might take troy and have a safe return if agamemnon would only give him back his daughter; and the other greeks assented, but agamemnon was wroth, and so on--the whole then becomes descriptive, and the poet is the only speaker left; or, if you omit the narrative, the whole becomes dialogue. EOS 'do you ask whether tragedy and comedy are to be admitted?' EOS yes, but also something more--is it not doubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all? EOS we cannot allow men to play the parts of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting against the gods,--least of all when making love or in labour. EOS but our state in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for complexity. EOS as we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the mixed lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and as our citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial harmonies, such as the ionian and pure lydian. EOS the lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town, and the pan's-pipe in the fields. EOS we only venture to affirm the general principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul should be reflected in them all. EOS sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to the law of simplicity. EOS some defect in the latter may be excused, but not in the former. EOS true love is the daughter of temperance, and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of bodily pleasure. EOS in the first place the guardians must abstain from strong drink, for they should be the last persons to lose their wits. EOS sicilian cookery and attic confections and corinthian courtezans, which are to gymnastic what lydian and ionian melodies are to music, must be forbidden. EOS eurypylus after he has been wounded drinks a posset of pramnian wine, which is of a heating nature; and yet the sons of asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him the drink, nor patroclus who is attending on him. EOS the truth is that this modern system of nursing diseases was introduced by herodicus the trainer; who, being of a sickly constitution, by a compound of training and medicine tortured first himself and then a good many other people, and lived a great deal longer than he had any right. EOS but how can excessive care of health be inconsistent with an ordinary occupation, and yet consistent with that practice of virtue which phocylides inculcates? EOS as to the story of pindar, that asclepius was slain by a thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie--following our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he was not the son of a god. EOS but the judge controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be corrupted by crime. EOS this is the ideal of a judge; the criminal turned detective is wonderfully suspicious, but when in company with good men who have experience, he is at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as himself. EOS and the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music which will give harmony to the soul, and good gymnastic which will give health to the body. EOS (it would perhaps be better to confine the term 'guardians' to this select class: the younger men may be called 'auxiliaries.') EOS 'i do not wonder at your being ashamed to propound such a fiction.' EOS there is more behind. EOS will our citizens ever believe all this? EOS their habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education. EOS they only of the citizens may not touch it, or be under the same roof with it, or drink from it; it is the accursed thing. EOS for there is a subtle influence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to poetry, just as the music and perfection of language are infused by poetry into prose. EOS there are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets which are far too obscure; in which there is no proportion between style and subject, in which any half-expressed figure, any harsh construction, any distorted collocation of words, any remote sequence of ideas is admitted; and there is no voice 'coming sweetly from nature,' or music adding the expression of feeling to thought. EOS as if there could be poetry without beauty, or beauty without ease and clearness. EOS whether or no, like some writers, he felt more than he expressed, it is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost entire silence about them. EOS in a remarkable passage of the laws it is acknowledged that the evil may form a correct estimate of the good. EOS at first seemed to be a paradox, yet was afterwards ascertained to be a truth. EOS and the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural sense independent of any special experience of good or evil. EOS mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be taught (as protagoras says, 'the myth is more interesting'), and also enables plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into details. EOS intervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law of their own, not dependent on the variations of sense. EOS are they two or one, and is either of them the cause of the other? EOS may we not at times drop the opposition between them, and the mode of describing them, which is so familiar to us, and yet hardly conveys any precise meaning, and try to view this composite creature, man, in a more simple manner? EOS must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times break asunder and take up arms against one another? EOS or again, they are reconciled and move together, either unconsciously in the ordinary work of life, or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim, to be attained not without an effort, and for which every thought and nerve are strained. EOS they are ever parting, ever meeting; and the identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most part unnoticed by us. EOS when the mind touches the body through the appetites, we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other. EOS he does not recognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily disorders; and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by little are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe. EOS 7. lesser matters of style may be remarked. EOS (5) the companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the valetudinarian, the satirical jest about the maxim of phocylides, the manner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up into the subject, and the argument from the practice of asclepius, should not escape notice. EOS 'well, and what answer do you give?' EOS if i went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply: 'the eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue as a whole.' EOS i have another remark to make:--a middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money enough to buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. EOS 'but then how will our poor city be able to go to war against an enemy who has money?' EOS there may be a difficulty in fighting against one enemy; against two there will be none. EOS in the first place, the contest will be carried on by trained warriors against well-to-do citizens: and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout opponents at least? EOS they are 'states,' but not 'a state'--many in one. EOS the meaning there implied was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and be at one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. EOS but if education remains in the established form, there will be no danger. EOS far be it from us to enter into the particulars of legislation; let the guardians take care of education, and education will take care of all other things. EOS evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces, nor the state which is like them. EOS 'yes, the men are as bad as the states.' EOS and now what remains of the work of legislation? EOS nothing for us; but to apollo the god of delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all things--that is to say, religion. EOS only our ancestral deity sitting upon the centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any sense, in an affair of such magnitude. EOS no foreign god shall be supreme in our realms...  here, as socrates would say, let us 'reflect on' (greek) what has preceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens, but only of the well-being of the state. EOS the greatest happiness of all is, as we believe, the far-off result of the divine government of the universe. EOS right and truth are the highest aims of government as well as of individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because we cannot directly enforce them. EOS that he was far from excluding the modern principle of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other passages; in which 'the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most honourable', and also 'the most sacred'. EOS we may note  (1) the manner in which the objection of adeimantus here, is designed to draw out and deepen the argument of socrates. EOS (3) the requirement that the state should be limited in size, after the traditional model of a greek state; as in the politics of aristotle, the fact that the cities of hellas were small is converted into a principle. EOS (5) the light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over when provision has been made for two great principles,--first, that religion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods, secondly, that the true national or hellenic type shall be maintained...  socrates proceeds: but where amid all this is justice? EOS this power which preserves right opinion about danger i would ask you to call 'courage,' adding the epithet 'political' or 'civilized' in order to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher courage which may hereafter be discussed. EOS and now we are near the spot; let us draw in and surround the cover and watch with all our eyes, lest justice should slip away and escape. EOS 'nay, i would have you lead.' EOS i begin to see a track. EOS for the definition which we believe to hold good in states has still to be tested by the individual. EOS if there be a fourth virtue, that can only be sought for in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in the state to one another. EOS it is obvious and simple, and for that very reason has not been found out. EOS for the definition here given of justice is verbally the same as one of the definitions of temperance given by socrates in the charmides, which however is only provisional, and is afterwards rejected. EOS and so far from justice remaining over when the other virtues are eliminated, the justice and temperance of the republic can with difficulty be distinguished. EOS yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort of harmony, and in this respect is akin to justice. EOS this receives an answer which is to the effect that there are four cardinal virtues (now for the first time brought together in ethical philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like aristotle's conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others, but the whole of virtue relative to the parts. EOS but first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul. EOS the word 'just,' whether applied to the individual or to the state, has the same meaning. EOS 'the shorter will satisfy me.' EOS and one form of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises a new point--thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of warm drink or of a particular kind of food, with the single exception of course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is good. EOS having cleared our ideas thus far, let us return to the original instance of thirst, which has a definite object--drink. EOS now is there not here a third principle which is often found to come to the assistance of reason against desire, but never of desire against reason? EOS this is passion or spirit, of the separate existence of which we may further convince ourselves by putting the following case:--when a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant at the hardships which he undergoes: but when he suffers unjustly, his indignation is his great support; hunger and thirst cannot tame him; the spirit within him must do or die, until the voice of the shepherd, that is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no more, is heard within. EOS each of the three classes will do the work of its own class in the state, and each part in the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion, the inferior, will be harmonized by the influence of music and gymnastic. EOS of justice we have already spoken; and the notion already given of it may be confirmed by common instances. EOS 'no.' EOS and injustice, which is the insubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul, is the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to the soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the body, good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. EOS and the state which corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have been describing, wherein reason rules under one of two names--monarchy and aristocracy. EOS but the path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he will not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. EOS secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced into either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is expressed: for example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. EOS he implies, what he does not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by the impulse of anger, a man is restrained from drinking, this proves that thirst, or desire under which thirst is included, is distinct from anger and reason. EOS but suppose that we allow the term 'thirst' or 'desire' to be modified, and say an 'angry thirst,' or a 'revengeful desire,' then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become confused. EOS these are the discussions of an age before logic; and any one who is wearied by them should remember that they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first development of the human faculties. EOS it is the peremptory military spirit which prevails in the government of honour. EOS we may observe how nearly plato approaches aristotle's famous thesis, that 'good actions produce good habits.' EOS in the sixth and seventh books (compare sophist and parmenides) he has given us a sketch of such a metaphysic; but when glaucon asks for the final revelation of the idea of good, he is put off with the declaration that he has not yet studied the preliminary sciences. EOS the aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits of human thought and language: they seem to have reached a height at which they are 'moving about in worlds unrealized,' and their conceptions, although profoundly affecting their own minds, become invisible or unintelligible to others. EOS but he makes only one or two steps forward on this path; he nowhere attains to any connected system of ideas, or even to a knowledge of the most elementary relations of the sciences to one another. EOS whom, i said, are you not going to let off? EOS is the first question. EOS is the second. EOS not that i mind a little innocent laughter; but he who kills the truth is a murderer. EOS 'then,' said glaucon, laughing, 'in case you should murder us we will acquit you beforehand, and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiving us.' EOS socrates proceeds:--the guardians of our state are to be watch-dogs, as we have already said. EOS but if women are to have the same employments as men, they must have the same education--they must be taught music and gymnastics, and the art of war. EOS the first question is, whether women are able either wholly or partially to share in the employments of men. EOS there was the difficulty, glaucon, which made me unwilling to speak of family relations. EOS women are the same in kind as men, and have the same aptitude or want of aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war, but in a less degree. EOS one woman will be a good guardian, another not; and the good must be chosen to be the colleagues of our guardians. EOS i meant to have escaped the trouble of proving the first, but as you have detected the little stratagem i must even submit. EOS in the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones where they are wanted, and their allies or ministers will obey. EOS but then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the state, for they will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desirable unions between their subjects. EOS and when children are born, the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried to an enclosure in a certain part of the city, and there attended by suitable nurses; the rest will be hurried away to places unknown. EOS the trouble of watching and getting up at night will be transferred to attendants. EOS the parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be reckoned at thirty years--from twenty-five, when he has 'passed the point at which the speed of life is greatest,' to fifty-five; and at twenty years for a woman--from twenty to forty. EOS any one above or below those ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety; also every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without the consent of the rulers. EOS socrates proceeds: i have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous and also consistent with our entire polity. EOS and there will be unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or interests--where if one member suffers all the members suffer, if one citizen is touched all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the little finger of the state runs through the whole body and vibrates to the soul. EOS every state has subjects and rulers, who in a democracy are called rulers, and in other states masters: but in our state they are called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in other states are termed slaves, are by us termed nurturers and paymasters, and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other places, are by us called fathers and brothers. EOS but no younger man will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from laying hands on his kindred, and he will fear that the rest of the family may retaliate. EOS cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen; gentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners, may be presented to the enemy. EOS but what shall be done to the hero? EOS when you see the towering crest of the wave, i expect you to take pity. EOS i would reduce them to a single one--the great wave, as i call it. EOS having the help of such a champion, i will do my best to maintain my position. EOS lovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their affection in every form. EOS those who recognize these realities are philosophers; whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours, and understand their use in the arts, but cannot attain to the true or waking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the light of knowledge, but of opinion, and what they see is a dream only. EOS suppose we say that, if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion only. EOS everything is and is not, as in the old riddle--'a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a bird with a stone and not a stone.' EOS the 'paradoxes,' as morgenstern terms them, of this book of the republic will be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the style, and some explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added. EOS plato is afraid of incestuous unions, but at the same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the city would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months after each hymeneal festival. EOS to us some of his difficulties are puzzling only from their simplicity: we do not perceive that the answer to them 'is tumbling out at our feet.' EOS the common term under which, through the accidental use of language, two entirely different ideas were included was another source of confusion. EOS thus through the ambiguity of (greek) plato, attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of human thought, seems to have confused perception and opinion, and to have failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative. EOS also they are of a social, gracious disposition, equally free from cowardice and arrogance. EOS can the god of jealousy himself find any fault with such an assemblage of good qualities? EOS 'then how is such an admission reconcileable with the doctrine that philosophers should be kings?' EOS conceive the captain of a ship, taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew, yet a little deaf, a little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman's art. EOS the sailors want to steer, although they know nothing of the art; and they have a theory that it cannot be learned. EOS he who joins in the mutiny is termed a good pilot and what not; they have no conception that the true pilot must observe the winds and the stars, and must be their master, whether they like it or not;--such an one would be called by them fool, prater, star-gazer. EOS this is my parable; which i will beg you to interpret for me to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name, and to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use him, are to blame for his uselessness. EOS need i recall the original image of the philosopher? EOS but as you were observing, if we turn aside to view the reality, we see that the persons who were thus described, with the exception of a small and useless class, are utter rogues. EOS but what numberless causes tend to destroy these rare beings! EOS further, i would have you consider that the hireling sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who knows how to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts. EOS if at this instant a friend whispers to him, 'now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be educated--do you think that he will listen? EOS or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted towards philosophy, will they not make herculean efforts to spoil and corrupt him? EOS and thus philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors, and others enter in and dishonour her. EOS will they not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth and nature? EOS 'they will.' EOS small, then, is the remnant of genuine philosophers; there may be a few who are citizens of small states, in which politics are not worth thinking of, or who have been detained by theages' bridle of ill health; for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique, and too rare to be worth mentioning. EOS and these few when they have tasted the pleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at that den of thieves and place of wild beasts, which is human life, will stand aside from the storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to preserve their own innocence and to depart in peace. EOS 'and is her proper state ours or some other?' EOS you may remember our saying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in states. EOS later, perhaps, they occasionally go to a lecture on philosophy. EOS then, when active life is over, let him finally return to philosophy. EOS 'you are in earnest, socrates, but the world will be equally earnest in withstanding you--no more than thrasymachus.' EOS who can hate a man who loves him? EOS when mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it? EOS that the philosopher is a lover of truth, having a nature akin to the best?--and if they admit this will they still quarrel with us for making philosophers our kings? EOS let us assume then that they are pacified. EOS 'enough seemed to have been said.' EOS i wish that i could, but in my present mood i cannot reach to the height of the knowledge of the good. EOS to the parent or principal i cannot introduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which i may compare with the interest on the principal, i will. EOS when the sun shines the eye sees, and in the intellectual world where truth is, there is sight and light. EOS and this idea of good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and the author not of knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than either in dignity and power. EOS none of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life. EOS like the ancient philosopher he sees the world pervaded by analogies, but he can also tell 'why in some cases a single instance is sufficient for an induction' (mill's logic), while in other cases a thousand examples would prove nothing. EOS adeimantus further argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts; for experience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues. EOS contrary to all expectation socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of this, and explains the anomaly in an allegory, first characteristically depreciating his own inventive powers. EOS the alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may be the elements of culture to another. EOS the 'monster' corporation to which they belong judges right and truth to be the pleasure of the community. EOS when the higher natures are corrupted by politics, the lower take possession of the vacant place of philosophy. EOS the answer is, that they do not know her. EOS but at the end of the sixth book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which all ideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a connected whole which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is the test of truth. EOS he does not explain to us in detail the nature of the process. EOS in entertaining such a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at least his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts of descartes, kant, hegel, and even of bacon himself, in modern philosophy. EOS plato represents these ideals in a figure as belonging to another world; and in modern times the idea will sometimes seem to precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand of the artist. EOS one man will have the whole in his mind before he begins; to another the processes of mind and hand will be simultaneous. EOS he had observed the use of mathematics in education; they were the best preparation for higher studies. EOS the subjective relation between them further suggested an objective one; although the passage from one to the other is really imaginary (metaph.). EOS for metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with mathematics; number and figure are the abstractions of time and space, not the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions. EOS true knowledge is a whole, and is at rest; consistency and universality are the tests of truth. EOS we cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage, but we may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are common to us and to plato: such as (1) the unity and correlation of the sciences, or rather of science, for in plato's time they were not yet parted off or distinguished; (2) the existence of a divine power, or life or idea or cause or reason, not yet conceived or no longer conceived as in the timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person; (3) the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of the mathematical sciences, and in a measure of every science when isolated from the rest; (4) the conviction of a truth which is invisible, and of a law, though hardly a law of nature, which permeates the intellectual rather than the visible world. EOS like them, we are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be revealed to a student of the mathematical sciences, and we are inclined to think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path to any satisfactory goal. EOS there was a need or instinct in the human soul which they satisfied; they were not ideas, but gods, and to this new mythology the men of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations of the elder deities. EOS the god of the timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good; they are aspects of the same, differing only as the personal from the impersonal, or the masculine from the neuter, the one being the expression or language of mythology, the other of philosophy. EOS this, or something like this, is the meaning of the idea of good as conceived by plato. EOS but if he could have been told that this, or some conception of the same kind, but higher than this, was the truth at which he was aiming, and the need which he sought to supply, he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his own thoughts than he himself knew. EOS nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of his disciples in a later generation; it was probably unintelligible to them. EOS at a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like the screen over which marionette players show their puppets. EOS they are ourselves, i replied; and they see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den; to these they give names, and if we add an echo which returns from the wall, the voices of the passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows. EOS suppose now that you suddenly turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the real images; will they believe them to be real? EOS last of all they will conclude:--this is he who gives us the year and the seasons, and is the author of all that we see. EOS how will they rejoice in passing from darkness to light! EOS now if you take such an one, and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul to earth, his intelligence will be turned round, and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends. EOS you must, each of you, take your turn, and become able to use your eyes in the dark, and with a little practice you will see far better than those who quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a dream only, whilst yours is a waking reality. EOS it may be that the saint or philosopher who is best fitted, may also be the least inclined to rule, but necessity is laid upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas. EOS nothing remains to us but that universal or primary science of which all the arts and sciences are partakers, i mean number or calculation. EOS for if agamemnon could not count his feet (and without number how could he?) EOS he must have been a pretty sort of general indeed. EOS but i am not speaking of these practical applications of arithmetic, for number, in my view, is rather to be regarded as a conductor to thought and being. EOS and the perception of their contrast or relation quickens and sets in motion the mind, which is puzzled by the confused intimations of sense, and has recourse to number in order to find out whether the things indicated are one or more than one. EOS that was what i meant when i spoke of stimulants to the intellect; i was thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception. EOS the retail use is not required by us; but as our guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the military one may be retained. EOS it is concerned, not with visible objects, but with abstract truth; for numbers are pure abstractions--the true arithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division. EOS shall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? EOS 'very good,' replied glaucon; 'the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at once for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.' EOS i like your way of giving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the world. EOS then take a step backward, for we are out of order, and insert the third dimension which is of solids, after the second which is of planes, and then you may proceed to solids in motion. EOS star-gazing is just looking up at the ceiling--no better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water--he may look up or look down, but there is no science in that. EOS all the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a copy which falls far short of the divine original, and teaches nothing about the absolute harmonies or motions of things. EOS the musicians put their ears in the place of their minds. EOS a thing, i replied, which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good. EOS what study do you mean--of the prelude, or what? EOS even so the dialectical faculty withdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the contemplation of the idea of good, and never rests but at the very end of the intellectual world. EOS dear glaucon, you cannot follow me here. EOS for all other arts or sciences are relative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are but a dream or hypothesis of true being, and never analyse their own principles. EOS dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above hypotheses, converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of the barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world, with the help of the sciences which we have been describing--sciences, as they are often termed, although they require some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science, and this in our previous sketch was understanding. EOS 'certainly not the latter.' EOS i dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and the process of selection may be carried a step further:--as before, they must be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but now they must also have natural ability which education will improve; that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil, retentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral virtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of ignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb, and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind. EOS this is just what happens with a man's principles. EOS what time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of the soul?--say, twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen years let the student go down into the den, and command armies, and gain experience of life. EOS when his time comes he shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest. EOS he shall be honoured with sacrifices, and receive such worship as the pythian oracle approves. EOS and you will admit that our state is not a mere aspiration, but may really come into being when there shall arise philosopher-kings, one or more, who will despise earthly vanities, and will be the servants of justice only. EOS the true dialectical process begins with the contemplation of the real stars, and not mere reflections of them, and ends with the recognition of the sun, or idea of good, as the parent not only of light but of warmth and growth. EOS he desires to develop in the human mind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last the particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. EOS he then seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense, not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the common use of language. EOS plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that it might be quickened by the study of number and relation. EOS his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical proportion in the ethics (book v), or between numerical and proportional equality in the politics. EOS he will observe that plato has a conception of geometry, in which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant and shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working geometrical problems by a more general mode of analysis. EOS still more will he be struck with the comprehensiveness of view which led plato, at a time when these sciences hardly existed, to say that they must be studied in relation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle of truth and being. EOS but he will also see (and perhaps without surprise) that in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge, plato has fallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a priori by mathematical problems, and determine the principles of harmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear. EOS it is worthy of remark that the old pythagorean ethical symbols still exist as figures of speech among ourselves. EOS first, that which relates to the analysis of vision. EOS the consciousness of form, colour, distance, is indistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of them. EOS three classes of harmonists are distinguished by him:--first, the pythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion on music he was to consult damon--they are acknowledged to be masters in the art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher import and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom glaucon appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and socrates ludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the intervals of sounds. EOS the den or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law (compare the description of the philosopher and lawyer in the theaetetus), and the light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing influence on the minds of those who return to this lower world. EOS in what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the lower world, or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle of politics, is left unexplained by plato. EOS (symposium.) EOS or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing institution may have darkened their vision. EOS they fall in love 'at first sight' with paradoxes respecting morality, some fancy about art, some novelty or eccentricity in religion, and like lovers they are so absorbed for a time in their new notion that they can think of nothing else. EOS the resolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them more interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of literature or science or even than a good life. EOS (for the last, compare the passage at the end of the third book, in which he expects the lie about the earthborn men to be believed in the second generation.) EOS then polemarchus and adeimantus interrupted you, and this led to another argument,--and so here we are.' EOS 'i should like to know of what constitutions you were speaking?' EOS this last will have to be compared with the perfectly just, which is the fifth, that we may know which is the happier, and then we shall be able to determine whether the argument of thrasymachus or our own is the more convincing. EOS and as before we began with the state and went on to the individual, so now, beginning with timocracy, let us go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to the other forms of government, and the individuals who answer to them. EOS the base of the number with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five and cubed, gives two harmonies:--the first a square number, which is a hundred times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong, being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which is five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. EOS this entire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of generation. EOS arts of war begin to prevail over arts of peace; the ruler is no longer a philosopher; as in oligarchies, there springs up among them an extravagant love of gain--get another man's and save your own, is their principle; and they have dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver, for the use of their women and others; they take their pleasures by stealth, like boys who are running away from their father--the law; and their education is not inspired by the muse, but imposed by the strong arm of power. EOS the leading characteristic of this state is party spirit and ambition. EOS in that respect, perhaps, but not in others. EOS as he advances in years he grows avaricious, for he has lost philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of men. EOS they are the drones of the hive; only whereas the actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the two-legged things whom we call drones are some of them without stings and some of them have dreadful stings; in other words, there are paupers and there are rogues. EOS these are never far apart; and in oligarchical cities, where nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler, you will find abundance of both. EOS like state, like man,--the change in the latter begins with the representative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his father, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and presently he sees him 'fallen from his high estate,' the victim of informers, dying in prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner. EOS avarice is enthroned as his bosom's lord, and assumes the style of the great king; the rational and spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one immersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of wealth. EOS the man is mean, saving, toiling, the slave of one passion which is the master of the rest: is he not the very image of the state? EOS he has had no education, or he would never have allowed the blind god of riches to lead the dance within him. EOS and being uneducated he will have many slavish desires, some beggarly, some knavish, breeding in his soul. EOS thus men of family often lose their property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city, full of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for revolution. EOS now there are occasions on which the governors and the governed meet together,--at festivals, on a journey, voyaging or fighting. EOS the great charm is, that you may do as you like; you may govern if you like, let it alone if you like; go to war and make peace if you feel disposed, and all quite irrespective of anybody else. EOS when in excess, they may be rightly called expensive pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones. EOS anarchy is the law, not of the state only, but of private houses, and extends even to the animals. EOS slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and there is no difference between men and women. EOS the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; for there is a law of contraries; the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom the greater the slavery. EOS then follow informations and convictions for treason. EOS even so the protector, who tastes human blood, and slays some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands, must either perish or become a wolf--that is, a tyrant. EOS now let the rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away again if he does not do so then. EOS in the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he is not a 'dominus,' no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt and the monopoly of land. EOS now his father is the demus, and if the demus gets angry, and says that a great hulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents, and bids him and his riotous crew begone, then will the parent know what a monster he has been nurturing, and that the son whom he would fain expel is too strong for him. EOS 'you do not mean to say that he will beat his father?' EOS the philosopher himself has lost the love of truth, and the soldier, who is of a simpler and honester nature, rules in his stead. EOS for there is no trace in greek history of a polity like the spartan or cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth, or of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy. EOS but then we must remember that plato is describing rather the contemporary governments of the sicilian states, which alternated between democracy and tyranny, than the ancient history of athens or corinth. EOS but if he is not a believer in liberty, still less is he a lover of tyranny. EOS at last, one monster passion takes possession of the whole nature of man--this is tyranny. EOS debt and land were the two great difficulties of the ancient lawgiver: in modern times we may be said to have almost, if not quite, solved the first of these difficulties, but hardly the second. EOS ), and would have been ridiculous to any reader of the republic who was acquainted with greek mathematics. EOS this is probably the number 216.  the explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up the number 8000. this explanation derives a certain plausibility from the circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the spartan citizens (herod. EOS ), and would be what plato might have called 'a number which nearly concerns the population of a city'; the mysterious disappearance of the spartan population may possibly have suggested to him the first cause of his decline of states. EOS thus 6, which is the first perfect or cyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. the words (greek), 'terms' or 'notes,' and (greek), 'intervals,' are applicable to music as well as to number and figure. EOS the words (greek) have been variously translated--'squared and cubed' (donaldson), 'equalling and equalled in power' (weber), 'by involution and evolution,' i.e. EOS by raising the power and extracting the root (as in the translation). EOS 8 and 27 = 2 cubed and 3 cubed; and conversely. EOS 12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21. EOS 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13. the words translated 'commensurable and agreeable to one another' (greek) seem to be different ways of describing the same relation, with more or less precision. EOS the first harmony is a 'square' number (greek); the second harmony is an 'oblong' number (greek), i.e. EOS (greek) = 'numbers squared from' or 'upon diameters'; (greek) = 'rational,' i.e. EOS now if we remember that the number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed, and 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared, we must admit that this number implies the numbers 3, 4, 5, to which musicians attach so much importance. EOS this second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former harmony is the square, and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3. in other words, the whole expression will be: (1), for the first harmony, 400/9: (2), for the second harmony, 8000/27.' EOS nor do i think that (greek) can mean 'two incommensurables,' which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3, but rather, as the preceding clause implies, (greek), i.e. EOS two square numbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is 5 = 50 x 2.  the greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the words (greek), 'a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied by 5.' EOS the discovery of the riddle would be useless, and would throw no light on ancient mathematics. EOS the number 5040, which is the number of the citizens in the laws, is expressly based by him on utilitarian grounds, namely, the convenience of the number for division; it is also made up of the first seven digits multiplied by one another. EOS 'true,' he said; 'very true.' EOS even in good men there is such an irregular wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. EOS to return:--you remember what was said of the democrat; that he was the son of a miserly father, who encouraged the saving desires and repressed the ornamental and expensive ones; presently the youth got into fine company, and began to entertain a dislike to his father's narrow ways; and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth, he came to a mean, and led a life, not of lawless or slavish passion, but of regular and successive indulgence. EOS love, like drunkenness and madness, is a tyranny; and the tyrannical man, whether made by nature or habit, is just a drinking, lusting, furious sort of animal. EOS and how does such an one live? EOS many desires require much money, and so he spends all that he has and borrows more; and when he has nothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were hatched, crying for food. EOS truly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother! EOS when there is no more to be got out of them, he turns burglar or pickpocket, or robs a temple. EOS assuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek, let us begin by comparing the individual and state, and ask first of all, whether the state is likely to be free or enslaved--will there not be a little freedom and a great deal of slavery? EOS he cannot do what he would, and his mind is full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman. EOS the state will be poor and full of misery and sorrow; and the man's soul will also be poor and full of sorrows, and he will be the most miserable of men. EOS but why? EOS and is not our tyrant such a captive soul, who is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge; living indoors always like a woman, and jealous of those who can go out and see the world? EOS this is our first proof. EOS the ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour; whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth, and will call other pleasures necessary rather than good. EOS now, how shall we decide between them? EOS next comes the life of ambition, and, in the third place, that of money-making. EOS thus rest or cessation is both pleasure and pain. EOS they can be best described in a simile. EOS again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and folly of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge of the other. EOS those who feast only on earthly food, are always going at random up to the middle and down again; but they never pass into the true upper world, or have a taste of true pleasure. EOS they are like fatted beasts, full of gluttony and sensuality, and ready to kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust; for they are not filled with true being, and their vessel is leaky (gorgias). EOS only when under the guidance of reason do either of the other principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is natural to them. EOS when not attaining, they compel the other parts of the soul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs. EOS the desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law, and those of the king are nearest to it. EOS there is one genuine pleasure, and two spurious ones: the tyrant goes beyond even the latter; he has run away altogether from law and reason. EOS nor can the measure of his inferiority be told, except in a figure. EOS perhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our discussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of justice. EOS is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; the ignoble, that which subjects the man to the beast? EOS and if so, who would receive gold on condition that he was to degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst?--who would sell his son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men, for any amount of money? EOS flattery and meanness again arise when the spirited element is subjected to avarice, and the lion is habituated to become a monkey. EOS for the same reason he will only accept such honours as will make him a better man; any others he will decline. EOS 'in that case,' said he, 'he will never be a politician.' EOS this is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which have no antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the philebus), such as the pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and anticipation. EOS in the previous book he had made the distinction between necessary and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by aristotle, and he now observes that there are a further class of 'wild beast' pleasures, corresponding to aristotle's (greek). EOS he is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is immeasurable, and invents a formula to give expression to his idea. EOS in speaking of the number 729 as proper to human life, he probably intended to intimate that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the royal life. EOS the simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is effected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the mathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. EOS 3. towards the close of the republic, plato seems to be more and more convinced of the ideal character of his own speculations. EOS ('say not lo! EOS he makes the gods also. EOS and this, without being really different, appears to be different, and has many points of view, of which only one is caught by the painter, who represents everything because he represents a piece of everything, and that piece an image. EOS and he can paint any other artist, although he knows nothing of their arts; and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or simple people. EOS friend homer, say i to him, i am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your poems incidentally refer, but about their main subjects--war, military tactics, politics. EOS if you are only twice and not thrice removed from the truth--not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what good you have ever done to mankind? EOS is there any city which professes to have received laws from you, as sicily and italy have from charondas, sparta from lycurgus, athens from solon? EOS or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to thales and anacharsis? EOS or is there any homeric way of life, such as the pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is called after you? EOS yes, but could this ever have happened if homer had really been the educator of hellas? EOS once more, the imitator has no knowledge of reality, but only of appearance. EOS the flute-player will know the good and bad flute, and the maker will put faith in him; but the imitator will neither know nor have faith--neither science nor true opinion can be ascribed to him. EOS and now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to imitation. EOS the imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary, in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result, and present experience of pleasure and pain. EOS feeling would lead him to indulge his sorrow, but reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he cannot know whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing is of any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good counsel. EOS unfortunately, however, this latter furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts. EOS the same is true of comedy,--you may often laugh at buffoonery which you would be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the stage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. EOS and therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of homer affirming that he is the educator of hellas, and that all life should be regulated by his precepts, we may allow the excellence of their intentions, and agree with them in thinking homer a great poet and tragedian. EOS these are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge us with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. EOS having come to years of discretion, we know that poetry is not truth, and that a man should be careful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he himself is; for there is a mighty issue at stake--no less than the good or evil of a human soul. EOS and yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than i have described. EOS 'and can we conceive things greater still?' EOS 'surely you are not prepared to prove that?' EOS you would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. EOS but none of these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body. EOS the soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not, by reason of them, brought any nearer to death. EOS but the soul which cannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be immortal and everlasting. EOS and if this be true, souls will always exist in the same number. EOS i granted, for the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might perhaps escape the knowledge of gods and men, although this was really impossible. EOS is not honesty the best policy? EOS the clever rogue makes a great start at first, but breaks down before he reaches the goal, and slinks away in dishonour; whereas the true runner perseveres to the end, and receives the prize. EOS but all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared with those which await good men after death. EOS he said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in which there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two corresponding chasms in the heaven above. EOS and he beheld and saw the souls departing after judgment at either chasm; some who came from earth, were worn and travel-stained; others, who came from heaven, were clean and bright. EOS he added something hardly worth repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were born. EOS (this ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant, who had murdered his father, and his elder brother, a thousand years before.) EOS the greatest terror of the pilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice, and when there was silence one by one they passed up with joy. EOS the ends of the column were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of necessity, on which all the heavenly bodies turned--the hook and spindle were of adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. EOS the whole had one motion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner circles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness and slowness. EOS after speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up the lot which fell near him. EOS he was one of those who had come from heaven, and in his previous life had been a citizen of a well-ordered state, but he had only habit and no philosophy. EOS to a man of genius who had a real appreciation of the godlike aeschylus and the noble and gentle sophocles, though disagreeing with some parts of their 'theology' (rep.), these 'minor poets' must have been contemptible and intolerable. EOS neither can any man live his life and act it. EOS in modern times we should say that art is not merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in forms of sense. EOS it is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned. EOS he asks only 'what good have they done?' EOS for plato is the prophet who 'came into the world to convince men'--first of the fallibility of sense and opinion, and secondly of the reality of abstract ideas. EOS unfortunately the very word 'idea,' which to plato is expressive of the most real of all things, is associated in our minds with an element of subjectiveness and unreality. EOS we may note also how he differs from aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history, for the opposite reason, because it is concerned with universals, not like history, with particulars (poet). EOS there is no difficulty in seeing that this is an illusion; for there is no more error or variation in an individual man, horse, bed, etc., than in the class man, horse, bed, etc. EOS but the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in all departments of life and knowledge, like the sophists and rhetoricians of the gorgias and phaedrus; they are the false priests, false prophets, lying spirits, enchanters of the world. EOS despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas and false teachers at its service--in the history of modern europe as well as of greece and rome. EOS plato is thinking in the first instance of greek poets who had graced the courts of dionysius or archelaus: and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their prostitution of the tragic muse in the praises of tyranny. EOS a further objection which plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts is that they excite the emotions. EOS and the vocation of art is to present thought in the form of feeling, to enlist the feelings on the side of reason, to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to suggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language is incapable of attaining. EOS true, the same power which in the purer age of art embodies gods and heroes only, may be made to express the voluptuous image of a corinthian courtezan. EOS in the present stage of the human mind, poetry and other forms of fiction may certainly be regarded as a good. EOS but may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some day exhausted? EOS the modern english novel which is the most popular of all forms of reading is not more than a century or two old: will the tale of love a hundred years hence, after so many thousand variations of the same theme, be still received with unabated interest? EOS and the revival or reform of religions, like the first revelation of them, has come from within and has generally disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments. EOS admitting that the arts, which some of us almost deify, have fallen short of their higher aim, we must admit on the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be suicidal as well as impossible. EOS no religion is wholly devoid of external forms; even the mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images has a temple in which he worships the most high, as solemn and beautiful as any greek or christian building. EOS plato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society. EOS possibly, like mephistopheles in faust, he may retaliate on his adversaries. EOS on the other hand, his argument that homer, if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth knowing, would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a rhapsodist, is both false and contrary to the spirit of plato (rep.). EOS it may be compared with those other paradoxes of the gorgias, that 'no statesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was the head'; and that 'no sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils' (gorg.)... EOS yet plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the incrustations of earth as to lose her original form; and in the timaeus he recognizes more strongly than in the republic the influence which the body has over the mind, denying even the voluntariness of human actions, on the ground that they proceed from physical states (tim.). EOS the tale has certainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the pilgrimages of the soul in the zend avesta (haug, avesta). EOS the philosophy of heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from zoroaster, and still less the myths of plato. EOS the spindle (which is of adamant) is fastened to the ends of the chains which extend to the middle of the column of light--this column is said to hold together the heaven; but whether it hangs from the spindle, or is at right angles to it, is not explained. EOS the cylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a symbol as the figure of necessity turning the spindle;--for the outermost rim is the sphere of the fixed stars, and nothing is said about the intervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens. EOS the column of light is not the milky way--which is neither straight, nor like a rainbow--but the imaginary axis of the earth. EOS the orrery or picture of the heavens given in the republic differs in its mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the other in the timaeus. EOS in both the fixed stars are distinguished from the planets, and they move in orbits without them, although in an opposite direction: in the republic as in the timaeus they are all moving round the axis of the world. EOS but we are not certain that in the former they are moving round the earth. EOS the relative thickness of the rims is perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the planets. EOS the giving of the lots, the weaving of them, and the making of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three fates--lachesis, clotho, atropos, are obviously derived from their names. EOS he who was moderately fortunate in the number of the lot--even the very last comer--might have a good life if he chose with wisdom. EOS the freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is distinctly asserted. EOS the life of man is 'rounded' by necessity; there are circumstances prior to birth which affect him (pol.). EOS but the lot of all men is good enough, if they choose wisely and will live diligently. EOS
